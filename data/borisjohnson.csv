2019-12-01 13:08:55+00:00,we will end the automatic early release system for serious and violent offenders so they serve their full term in prison ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:12+00:00,those changes meant that although four senior judges considered that khan was dangerous he was to be automatically released half way through because of labour s law that is why we are determined to change this ensure dangerous terrorists serve their full sentence  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:12+00:00,nowhere in the judgment did lord justice leveson suggest that khan s release would have been subject to the parole board approval indeed lord justice leveson did not have the power to require that because of how labour changed the law in,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:12+00:00,a number of people have pointed out that the judgment of the court of appeal makes a reference to the parole board if you look at the whole quote it s clear lord justice leveson is not even talking about khan  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:10+00:00,unfortunately khan could not be sentenced under the eds scheme because it was not yet in force in december when he committed the offence had labour not changed the law in khan would not have been automatically released in december,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:10+00:00,if khan had been sentenced under the new eds scheme there would have been no automatic early release and he would only have been able to ask for parole board consideration at rds of his sentence under this system he could not have been released before mid,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:09+00:00,had the changes to the law not been made he would not have been eligible for automatic early release instead the parole board would have had to decide whether he was safe to be released  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:09+00:00,khan was sentenced under labour s old regime therefore he was to be automatically released after serving only half of his sentence i e years given time on remand this meant he was released in december,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:09+00:00,however since the judges still considered him to be dangerous he got an epp the court of appeal could not have given him an eds because these were not in force when he committed the offence in december,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:09+00:00,this means khan would be detained indefinitely after he has served the minimum term unless the parole board considered him safe khan appealed the court of appeal agreed that he was dangerous but felt that his crime was not serious enough to warrant an ipp  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:08+00:00,khan was sentenced by the crown court on th february  he was considered dangerous by the judge and so the two possible options available at the time were ipp or post epp the judge opted for ipp with a minimum term of years  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:08+00:00,the prison reform trust has a helpful summary of how the epp scheme changed in,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:06+00:00,in labour introduced the criminal justice and immigration act  this removed the requirement of parole board approval this meant that for epps after  release would be automatic at the halfway point no matter how dangerous the criminal  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:05+00:00,an epp has two elements a custodial part and an extended licence period when epps were brought in by the criminal justice act  there was no automatic early release during the custodial part see s  b of the original act  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:03+00:00,all those regimes have in common is the fact that they apply if the judge considers the offender to be dangerous  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:03+00:00,there are distinct sentencing legal regimes that have been confused in this case indefinite sentences for public protection ipp pre extended sentences for public protection dpp post epps extended determinate sentences eds which came into force in dec  ,BorisJohnson
2019-12-01 09:43:03+00:00,the terrible khan case has highlighted a complicated area of law there have been many inaccuracies reported about this case over the last hours here are the details  ,BorisJohnson
