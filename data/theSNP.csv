2019-12-19 09:29:57+00:00,ns this is not the time for scotland to give up on reasoned and democratic argument it is the time to pursue it ever more confidently let s assert our rights as an equal nation and partner ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:28:49+00:00,ns the tory position will not prevail democracy will so today i urge people in scotland regardless of our differing views on independence to rally round the case for scotland s right to choose our right to self determination ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:28:35+00:00,ns that is not a union worthy of the name and it is most certainly not a union of equals it is instead a raw assertion of westminster control over scotland and it is not sustainable ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:28:34+00:00,ns they are imposing damaging change stripping us of rights and re making our future without our consent all of this and more is being done against the wishes of the people of scotland ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:28:34+00:00,ns a tory trump trade deal will leave our nhs at the mercy of us drugs companies their social security policy will drive many more children into poverty ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:27:49+00:00,ns they ve taken powers from the scottish parliament they re threatening workers rights and environmental standards their migration policy will lead to a fall in our working population and hit our economy hard ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:27:48+00:00,ns but it s not just the fact that the tories want to take scotland out of the eu against our will and contrary to the promises they made in  they dismissed a compromise proposal to stay in the single market ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:27:18+00:00,ns despite that overwhelming vote within a matter of weeks the tories intend to remove scotland from the eu the future the people of scotland once chose is no longer available to them ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:27:17+00:00,ns in a majority of people in scotland did indeed vote no but in an overwhelming majority voted to remain in the european union ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:27:16+00:00,ns the tories are in effect saying to people here that democracy in scotland stopped the day we voted no in  that cannot and will not hold ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:27:15+00:00,ns the conservative s only response to this so far has been the referendum result in  they use that result to justify doing whatever they like to scotland no matter what people here think and no matter how much damage they cause to people s lives ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:26:18+00:00,ns it is for the prime minister to explain why he believes it is acceptable to ignore election after election in scotland and to over ride a democratic mandate stronger than the one he claims for his brexit deal ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:25:59+00:00,ns it is for the prime minister to defend why he believes the uk is not a voluntary union of equal nations it is for the prime minister to set out why he does not believe people in scotland have the right to self determination ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:25:58+00:00,ns but the document we are publishing today turns the question on its head ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:25:26+00:00,ns in the new year i will also ask the scottish parliament to back the case we are publishing today and we will work to grow and deepen the coalition of support for scotland s right to choose ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:25:26+00:00,ns in this context the question is often posed to me what will you do if boris johnson says no as i have said before i will consider all reasonable options to secure scotland s right to self determination ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:25:19+00:00,ns of course much of the debate at westminster has been based on the idea that it is the right of the westminster parliament and the prime minister of the day not the people who live here to determine scotland s future ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:25:18+00:00,ns and we are setting out that case in detail because we believe that the uk government on this as on any issue has a duty to respond in a similarly considered and reasonable manner ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:24:23+00:00,ns but they should be under no illusion that this will be an end of the matter we will continue to pursue the democratic case for scotland s right to choose we will do so in a reasonable and considered manner ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:24:22+00:00,ns together with the constitutional and democratic case for that transfer of power we are also publishing the draft legislation that would give effect to it of course i anticipate that in the short term we will simply hear a restatement of the uk government s opposition ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:24:21+00:00,ns we are therefore today calling for the uk government to negotiate and agree the transfer of power that would put beyond doubt the scottish parliament s right to legislate for a referendum on independence ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:23:34+00:00,ns in line with our values we acknowledge that a referendum must be legal and that it must be accepted as legitimate here in scotland and the rest of the uk as well as in the eu and the wider international community ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:23:15+00:00,ns the scottish government believes that right should be exercised free from the threat of legal challenge ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:23:03+00:00,ns and now the election is over i believe an even broader coalition is being formed the right to choose is not just a demand from me as first minister or from the snp it is based on the solemn right of the people of scotland to decide their own future ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:22:40+00:00,ns but the election last week put beyond reasonable argument our mandate to offer people in scotland the choice we built a coalition around this principle ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:22:38+00:00,ns and of course in a referendum those who believe that scotland should stay part of the westminster union will be able to make that case so i accept that the case for independence is yet to be won ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:22:14+00:00,ns i recognise the work we have to do to persuade a clear majority of people in scotland that independence is the best future for our country that is why in the months ahead we will update the detailed and substantive case for scotland becoming an independent nation ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:22:11+00:00,ns now let me be clear again that i don t take the outcome of an independence referendum for granted nor do i assume that everyone who voted snp last week necessarily supports independence ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:21:44+00:00,ns the snp victory last week follows others in and  so the mandate we have to offer the scottish people a choice over their future is by any normal standard of democracy unarguable ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:21:43+00:00,ns the snp won that election convincingly with a higher vote share and a higher percentage of seats than the tories won uk wide the conservatives in scotland who campaigned relentlessly on the single issue of opposition to another referendum lost overwhelmingly ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:21:14+00:00,ns our manifesto said this an snp election victory will be a clear instruction by the people of scotland that a new referendum on independence should be held next year on a precise date to be determined by the scottish parliament ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:20:47+00:00,ns there has been a material change in circumstances there is also a democratic mandate to offer that choice in the election last thursday the snp campaigned explicitly on the clear pledge that scotland s future should be in scotland s hands ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:20:45+00:00,ns but that is the future we face if we don t have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence and it is a very different future to the one in prospect when scotland voted no to independence in  ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:20:16+00:00,ns scotland made clear last week that it doesn t want a tory government led by boris johnson taking us out of europe and down a path we haven t chosen ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:20:15+00:00,ns the ability for scotland to exercise that right now matters because the alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:20:15+00:00,ns nor is it right for it to be over ridden by a prime minister or indeed a first minister it is a fundamental right of self determination ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:19:23+00:00,ns in a voluntary association of nations such as the uk it cannot be in the interest of any part for our right to choose our own future to be conditional or time limited or a one off ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:19:21+00:00,ns it is rooted in the principle of self determination in the material change of circumstances since the exercise of that right and in the democratic mandate that exists for offering the choice afresh ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:19:21+00:00,ns but the choice must be ours today i am publishing the constitutional and democratic case for scotland having that choice ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:19:19+00:00,ns and as a nation our future whatever we choose it to be must be in the hands of the people who live here we can choose to stay part of the westminster union or we can choose as i would to be independent ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:18:28+00:00,ns and about our future what kind of country and society do we want to be at the heart of these questions is a belief held by almost everyone in scotland that we are a nation no better and no worse than any other but an equal nation ,theSNP
2019-12-19 09:18:16+00:00,ns the experience of the last three and a half years has raised big questions about how we see ourselves as a country and our place in the world it has raised questions about our voice and our democracy ,theSNP

2019-12-17 14:34:24+00:00,ns that is not a task for any one party although as scotland s government my party will take a lead ,theSNP

2019-12-17 14:33:58+00:00,ns however independence is not an end in itself it is all about building a fairer and more prosperous country and so we will also do everything we can to achieve that with the powers we have right now ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:33:58+00:00,ns this parliament has a duty to protect the values that people in scotland voted for i believe we can only fully do that with independence and that is why later this week i will take the next steps to secure scotland s right to choose ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:32:59+00:00,ns we are facing a conservative government that scotland did not vote for indeed overwhelmingly rejected and which many fear will pose a real danger to our country and the fabric of our society ,theSNP

2019-12-17 14:32:25+00:00,ns so in the spirit in which this parliament was established and notwithstanding the many disagreements between us i hope we can find common ground and work together on a range of issues ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:32:13+00:00,ns while contingency planning and alternative options have been under consideration for some time meeting this timetable will require parties to work together ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:31:59+00:00,ns at this point the uk government has not confirmed when it will produce its own budget and with it the block grant adjustments for scotland but it may not be until march ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:31:59+00:00,ns this parliament is required to deliver a budget before the start of the next financial year and scotland s local authorities would expect to set their budgets in late february or early march ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:31:58+00:00,ns there is also a particular and immediate challenge that will require cross party co operation ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:31:13+00:00,ns and we will listen to the conclusions of the citizens assembly when it reports in the spring about what kind of country we should be seeking to build ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:31:01+00:00,ns we will also engage with the standing council on europe to ensure that we take whatever steps we can to retain our relationships within europe and identify ways to ensure our voice and our interests continue to be heard ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:30:48+00:00,ns this will include civic society trade unions and the business community religious and minority groups and our partners in local government ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:30:36+00:00,ns to that end just as we did in the immediate aftermath of the brexit vote in  the scottish government will in january convene a number of round table meetings bringing together key groups that represent different aspects of scottish life ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:30:16+00:00,ns and of course brexit is the cause of significant uncertainty and worry for our fellow eu citizens who contribute so much to modern scotland scotland must respond to and seek to overcome these challenges ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:30:04+00:00,ns brexit will also put parts of our health service in the sights of us trade negotiators it could mean for example that the nhs has to pay higher prices for drugs ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:30:03+00:00,ns the hard possibly no deal brexit favoured by the prime minister poses a real danger to our economy and to social and environmental safeguards at a time when we must substantially step up our efforts to tackle climate change ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:29:40+00:00,ns if the uk government was to press ahead without that consent it would be further proof of westminster s contempt for devolution and its willingness to tear up established constitutional rules in its pursuit of brexit ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:29:40+00:00,ns this parliament will have to consider whether or not it will give consent to this bill ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:29:21+00:00,ns now it seems the prime minister is determined to quickly push through the withdrawal agreement bill ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:29:20+00:00,ns throughout the brexit process the westminster government has ignored the wishes of the people of scotland and the views of this parliament ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:29:01+00:00,ns and of course it now seems inevitable that at the end of january scotland will be taken out of the european union against our will ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:28:50+00:00,ns that means our child poverty action plan and our work to implement the new scottish child payment will be even more important than it was already ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:28:37+00:00,ns by  more than one in three children across the uk could be living in poverty i am sure that no one in this chamber will find that remotely acceptable ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:28:37+00:00,ns to cite just one example the resolution foundation last month published research showing that under conservative plans for social security child poverty could reach a year high ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:28:14+00:00,ns of course we must also re double our efforts to protect scotland as best we can with the powers we already have this government is determined to do that and i would ask other parties in this chamber to support us in that task ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:28:13+00:00,ns so i hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of scotland s right to choose a better future ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:27:50+00:00,ns but a new brexit focused tory government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:27:35+00:00,ns that resulted in the establishment of this parliament it has achieved much ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:27:35+00:00,ns back in the early s when scotland was also facing the prospect of a fourth tory government with no mandate here there was a coming together of political parties communities and civic scotland ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:27:12+00:00,ns given the nature of what we are facing in terms of uk governance this is now a matter of some urgency which is why this government wants people to have a choice next year ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:26:59+00:00,ns but nevertheless it is clear that there is a growing cross party recognition that election mandates should be honoured that there has been a material change of circumstances and that the question of independence must be decided by the people and not by politicians ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:26:59+00:00,ns i recognise the work that those of us who support independence still have to do to persuade a clear majority in scotland that it is the best way forward for our country ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:26:33+00:00,ns i welcome that but let me be clear about this i do not assume that an acceptance of scotland s right to choose will always equate to support for independence just as i do not assume that everyone who voted snp last week is yet ready to vote for independence ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:26:33+00:00,ns there are already some signs that those who previously opposed an independence referendum are when faced with the democratic reality of thursday s result now re thinking that position ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:26:32+00:00,ns this parliament will also vote on the final stage of the referendums scotland bill which puts in place the framework for a future referendum ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:25:56+00:00,ns thats why later this week in line with repeated election mandates reinforced on thursday i will publish the detailed democratic case for a transfer of power from westminster to this parliament to allow for an independence referendum that is beyond legal challenge ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:25:56+00:00,ns it is essential therefore that a future outside of europe and governed by an increasingly right wing conservative government is not foisted upon scotland instead we must have the right to consider the alternative of independence ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:25:55+00:00,ns the kind of future desired by most people in scotland is very clearly different to that favored by much of the rest of the uk ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:25:55+00:00,ns presiding officer such a democratic deficit is not just undesirable it is also unsustainable the fact is that this election demonstrated a fundamental point ,theSNP

2019-12-17 14:24:03+00:00,ns  of seats were won by pro eu or pro eu referendum parties but regardless we are set to be dragged out of the eu against our will ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:23:36+00:00,ns but in spite of that we face a majority tory government implementing a manifesto that scotland rejected furthermore of votes in scotland were cast for parties that either supported remaining in the eu or were in favour of a second eu referendum ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:23:15+00:00,ns in fact the conservatives have now lost consecutive westminster elections in scotland stretching back to  ,theSNP

2019-12-17 14:22:40+00:00,ns by contrast while the conservative party won a majority uk wide they were once again heavily defeated here in scotland having fought the election on the single issue of opposition to an independence referendum ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:22:28+00:00,ns it was an endorsement of our election message that scotland does not want a boris johnson government and we don t want to leave the eu and that while opinions may differ on the substantive question of independence we do want scotland s future to be in scotland s hands ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:22:07+00:00,ns that is by any measure a significant vote of confidence i and my colleagues will work each and every day to repay the trust that has been placed in us ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:21:57+00:00,ns indeed you have to go as far back as the election of ted heath in  the year i was born to find a party that got a higher share of the vote across the uk than the snp did in scotland last week ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:21:43+00:00,ns presiding officer the election was comprehensively won in scotland by the snp ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:21:28+00:00,ns however notwithstanding the challenges of bad weather and dark nights it is important to note that turnout in scotland actually increased a fact that i am sure will be welcomed by all of us ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:21:17+00:00,ns in addition it s worth recognising that this was the first december general election in more than years i suspect that the candidates and activists who are still thawing out will hope that it is some time until the next winter election ,theSNP
2019-12-17 14:20:51+00:00,ns and i commiserate with unsuccessful candidates as somebody who stood unsuccessfully in two westminster general elections i have a good understanding of how they feel ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:44:34+00:00,ns all of that progress is at risk if boris johnson gets the majority he is seeking so at this election scotland is facing a crucial question who should decide our future the people who live here or the likes of boris johnson ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:43:38+00:00,ns and of course a vote for the snp is a vote to protect scotland from being at the mercy of a donald trump trade deal it is a chance to secure a future as part of the world s biggest trading block in which all members have to give their consent to trade deals ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:42:56+00:00,ns a vote for the snp is also a vote to end the democratic outrage of westminster tory governments with no mandate in scotland to move on from right wing tories itching to get their hands on devolution ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:42:14+00:00,ns a vote for the snp is also a vote for a migration policy tailored to our needs we can end the hostile environment we can retain freedom of movement ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:41:59+00:00,ns as an independent country scotland would be in a unique position to act as a bridge between the rest of the uk and the eu making us a magnet for global investment which in turn would boost growth and tax revenues for public services ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:41:58+00:00,ns if we look at ireland it is striking how the combination of independence and eu membership led to huge economic gains ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:41:04+00:00,ns and if the future we then choose is as an independent member of the eu we will be able to take full advantage of the single market currently around eight times the size of the uk alone ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:40:41+00:00,ns but more fundamentally a vote for the snp is a vote to escape brexit and the threats it poses to our economy and public services it is a vote to secure the right to choose our own future ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:40:27+00:00,ns but scotland s future should not be dependent on the whims of westminster a vote for the snp is a vote to deprive boris johnson of the majority that would enable him to do all of this ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:40:02+00:00,ns of course snp mps will do all they can to stop this from happening the snp will introduce an nhs protection bill to explicitly protect the nhs in all four countries of the uk from being a bargaining chip in future trade deals ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:39:34+00:00,ns in government the tories have made it clear they are prepared to rip up the devolution settlement if it gets in the way of brexit so we should be in no doubt they will do the same if devolution gets in the way of a trump trade deal ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:37:56+00:00,ns the so called tory detoxification strategy designed to convince voters in scotland that the conservatives now embrace devolution has proved to be short lived they ve already used brexit to grab powers from the scottish parliament ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:37:35+00:00,ns the third threat comes from the tory power grab on the scottish parliament in their pursuit of their brexit vision remember the tories fought tooth and nail against devolution in the first place ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:37:13+00:00,ns in this election the tories are deliberately giving the impression our fellow eu citizens are a burden on the nhs instead of a vital support that is a disgrace and it has to stop ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:36:50+00:00,ns and they accepted that the care sector would face even more serious problems if migration from the eu was restricted yet this is precisely the scenario that this sector faces ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:35:46+00:00,ns the second threat is to the workforce the end of freedom of movement will make it harder to attract nhs and social care staff and it will mean fewer people working in scotland and therefore contributing tax revenue to public services ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:35:25+00:00,ns and leaving with no trade deal which is still a distinct possibility could see that rise to  billion ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:35:12+00:00,ns leaving the eu will mean lower economic growth and therefore lower tax revenue to fund public services by the end of the next decade a trade deal such as the one favoured by boris johnson could wipe billion from the scottish economy relative to eu membership ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:34:41+00:00,ns let me outline three of those threats and how a vote for the snp can head them off first of all there is the direct economic threat of brexit ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:34:21+00:00,ns that s why this election is so vital it will determine what path scotland takes will these threats become reality or will we decide differently by taking our future into our hands rather than leaving it in the hands of boris johnson and a broken westminster system ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:33:50+00:00,ns and make no mistake it is now crystal clear that continued westminster control means multiple threats to scotland to our economy and our living standards and to our nhs and other public services ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:33:50+00:00,ns they are for westminster control every time no matter how many tory governments we get and no matter how much damage the tories do to scotland ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:33:16+00:00,ns although their policy on whether to give people the right to choose their own future in a new independence referendum seems to change with the wind there is no doubt where they stand on the substantive question ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:32:59+00:00,ns they would rather see scotland s future in boris johnson s hands than in the hands of the people of scotland ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:32:47+00:00,ns and of course fundamentally when it comes to a choice for scotland between westminster control and becoming an independent country labour always supports tory government over self government ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:32:23+00:00,ns if people in scotland want to make sure boris johnson does not get a majority if they want to see a progressive alliance formed with scotland s interests front and centre and the tories locked out of government then only a vote for the snp can deliver that outcome ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:31:54+00:00,ns and the fact is labour cannot win in scotland in all of the seats the conservatives hold in scotland it is the snp who are the challengers ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:31:37+00:00,ns that might explain at least in part why people in scotland simply don t see the point in voting labour anymore the snp is already delivering what they are only promising ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:31:36+00:00,ns from free prescriptions to abolishing university tuition fees to free personal care to public ownership of the water industry and opposition to fracking labour has clearly been looking to scotland for inspiration ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:31:36+00:00,ns so although the labour party aggressively attacks the snp it is striking just how much of their policy platform at this election borrows from what the snp has already done in government ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:30:51+00:00,ns one of the great advantages of countries of our size as we see in other comparable nations is a sense of cohesion solidarity and shared goals ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:30:26+00:00,ns any government will face difficult tests that is of course true for the snp as it is for governments everywhere but this scottish model i have outlined universal public services paid for through progressive taxation has broad consensus support in scotland ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:26:20+00:00,ns by contrast in scotland the snp has increased the number of police officers by more than  in fact just to match us and restore england s share of police officers uk wide the tories would need not the  extra police officers they are promising but  ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:25:36+00:00,ns and in policing since  when the snp first came into government we have been investing while westminster has been cutting in england police numbers have been cut by more than  the tory pledge at this election doesn t even fully reverse that cut ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:25:09+00:00,ns last week i heard a tory turned lib dem say that free tuition was and i quote a fantasy perhaps he s not familiar with scotland but let me say very clearly free tuition in scotland is very much a reality and it is one the snp will always protect ,theSNP

2019-11-20 12:22:30+00:00,ns it s an expression of our values and of our solidarity it s an example of the approach the snp has taken in government a scottish model for public services ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:22:10+00:00,ns it s important to make this point free prescriptions and free personal care are not giveaways they are an important part of the universal principle that underpins the nhs the provision of care free at the point of use paid for collectively ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:21:41+00:00,ns and in government the snp has abolished prescription charges protected free personal care for older people and extended it now to people of all ages ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:20:47+00:00,ns by contrast the snp in government in scotland with limited taxation powers has prioritised investment in our nhs and other public services over tax cuts for the richest we ve introduced a fairer tax system and put record sums into the nhs ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:20:22+00:00,ns and let s not forget that s a cut inflicted not just by the tories but also in part by the liberal democrats when they were in coalition with the tories that is something voters in scotland should not and will not forget ,theSNP
2019-11-20 12:19:27+00:00,ns that democratic cost comes with a severe practical cost to people s lives tory austerity over the last ten years has hit public services hard by the end of this decade westminster will have cut scotland s budget by billion in real terms ,theSNP

2019-05-29 12:42:45+00:00,mr that is about the journey let me now turn to the destination and the three areas of activity which the first minister set out in her april statement ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:42:18+00:00,mr these matters will be discussed at the next jmc due before the end of june we must see significant progress on them if those meetings are to have any future purpose ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:41:46+00:00,mr there needs to be a clear and urgent timetable for the current inter governmental review which must secure a legal underpinning to the relationship and the uk government must commit to respecting the legislative consent mechanism rather than ignoring it ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:41:45+00:00,mr there must be a new meaningful respect for our position and for the responsibilities which are ours as of right ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:41:07+00:00,mr she had and continues to have no interest in seeing the devolved settlement observed now she is going that must change ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:40:45+00:00,mr they have consistently and fundamentally been ignored by the uk government and that strategy was i believe at the express wish of the current prime minister imposed upon her ministers at every level and at every turn ,theSNP

2019-05-29 12:40:05+00:00,mr the destination the scottish government wishes for this country is independence but as we travel towards that we have a role in helping to improve the structures under which we presently live and work ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:39:49+00:00,mr so firstly as context i can confirm that despite the chaos we witness in whitehall my colleagues and i will continue to attend intergovernmental meetings with uk and wales and hopefully soon northern ireland counterparts ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:39:10+00:00,mr the first minister said last month that we must reach out and be inclusive and our approach to the three tasks we are now taking forward has been and is just that ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:38:50+00:00,mr it will not be easy but at least we start on that process with a high degree of consensus about the basic fact the westminster system is broken and there is no mending of it in sight ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:38:34+00:00,mr to do that we must approach our collective national future in a spirit of openness and acceptance that we all want the best for our country we must be mindful not just of those who won but also those who lost not just this week nor even just in but in too ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:38:17+00:00,mr the current prime minister did none of that when in office and the baleful result is there for all to see we must try to break the current logjam with the power of fresh ideas ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:37:54+00:00,mr but as we seek that way forward we must try to build as much consensus as we can one thing we have learnt from brexit is this that there is a need for reconciliation and the bringing together of different views ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:37:35+00:00,mr there must be and there is a better way forward that is in our view for scotland to become an independent european nation ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:37:09+00:00,mr the assumption that a uk government and a uk parliament would or could in any way do better for scotland than our own independent institutions has been finally and completely destroyed ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:36:50+00:00,mr the third anniversary of the brexit referendum will be with us in less than a month s time the accelerating shambles has caused and is causing real damage to scotland s economy and our social fabric ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:36:50+00:00,mr in particular we will continue to support a second referendum on eu membership a position which received widespread support on thursday but time is running out ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:36:49+00:00,mr the scottish government and the snp at westminster will of course continue to do all we can to stop brexit for the whole uk ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:36:01+00:00,mr it will be yet further proof that the conditions set out in our manifesto in april have been met in full and there will be an even greater urgency to give scotland the choice of a different future ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:36:00+00:00,mr and if a new tory prime minister attempts a no deal brexit whilst we will do everything possible to stop it and everything we can to mitigate it ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:35:26+00:00,mr any deal which takes scotland out of the eu against the wishes of the majority has that effect that is what people voted for when they voted the snp into government ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:35:26+00:00,mr if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in  such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:35:25+00:00,mr the snp manifesto on which we won the holyrood election and on which this government is founded said the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:34:11+00:00,mr so let me at the outset make one thing very clear to the tories at westminster and to the tories in this chamber ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:33:52+00:00,mr substitute raab or leadsom or gove or hancock or mcvey or any of the others for johnson and the situation is no better most are heading with pleasure to the cliff edge but scotland must not be forced against our will to go with them ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:33:34+00:00,mr the tories are heading for a no deal brexit and some positively welcome that disastrous direction of travel a boris johnson premiership is no longer a bad joke it is a frightening possibility ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:33:12+00:00,mr not only has nothing happened to resolve the brexit impasse but now the stalemate looks like lasting for several more months whilst ever more extreme tory mps vie with each other to present the most hard line positions to their party faithful ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:33:00+00:00,mr on the th of april when the eu threw the uk a lifeline to avoid a no deal brexit donald tusk the president of the european council said to westminster please don t waste this time but he has been ignored ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:32:37+00:00,mr so if all the parties in this chamber are willing to hear the clear voice of scotland then i believe we can find a way to put behind us the divisions of brexit and move forward together and that is what this statement is about ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:32:23+00:00,mr elections can be brutal judgements on parties and politicians this one certainly was but presiding officer elections can also be fresh starts ,theSNP
2019-05-29 12:32:03+00:00,mr last thursday scotland said loudly and clearly that it is a european nation and it intends to remain one it also rejected all attempts to deflect that argument with spurious assertions about other matters and showed its contempt for equivocation ,theSNP

2019-02-19 17:01:19+00:00,fm this option does not currently have the parliamentary support it needs however it remains one way out of the problems the uk has created for itself ,theSNP
2019-02-19 17:01:19+00:00,fm a second vote could be based on a much clearer understanding of what the leave option actually means in practice ,theSNP
2019-02-19 17:00:30+00:00,fm that allowed the eu to serve as a scapegoat for more general discontents for example an entirely justified dissatisfaction about austerity inequality and stagnant living standards ,theSNP
2019-02-19 17:00:30+00:00,fm at the time of the referendum people who opted to leave knew that they were voting against eu membership but they did not know what they were voting for ,theSNP
2019-02-19 17:00:30+00:00,fm and for all voters it is a chance to make a decision based on much more detailed information than was ever made available in ,theSNP
2019-02-19 17:00:29+00:00,fm there is a strong democratic case for that for parliament it is a way to break the deadlock for scotland it is an opportunity for our wish to stay in the eu to be respected ,theSNP
2019-02-19 17:00:29+00:00,fm that is why the alternative option is now the preferred one for me and many others a second referendum offering people the choice to remain in the eu ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:59:30+00:00,fm however there is no sign so far of the prime minister being willing to contemplate such an approach and of course even if she was there may be too little time left to achieve a guarantee of it before the uk relinquishes eu membership ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:59:30+00:00,fm among other things that would make it far easier to maintain an open border on ireland it is the uk s chosen red lines that currently make that solution impossible ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:59:29+00:00,fm beyond that i believe there are two options the uk government could drop its self defeating red lines and at long last stand up to the more extreme brexiteer element in its ranks and agree to the uk as a whole remaining firmly within the single market and customs union ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:59:29+00:00,fm i sincerely hope france would lend its support such an extension however i am well aware that a new european parliamentary session starts on july and so i know that the time of any extension and indeed the purpose of it would need to be considered carefully ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:59:29+00:00,fm and in any event it has been obvious for some time now that the uk is not remotely prepared to leave the eu on march ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:59:28+00:00,fm the uk prime minister should therefore write immediately to the european union requesting an extension to the article process that would alleviate the most immediate time pressure ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:58:18+00:00,fm firstly the uk government should make it clear that it would not support the uk leaving the eu on the march without a deal in place such an outcome would be disastrous ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:58:18+00:00,fm in addition we still believe that there are still possible routes to a better outcome however to achieve that the uk government would have to alter its approach ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:58:18+00:00,fm but no government of scotland which has the interests of this and future generations at heart could possibly support the current deal ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:58:18+00:00,fm and i appreciate that many people in france and across the eu would like the uk to just get on with it ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:58:17+00:00,fm all of this is down to the red lines that uk government has chosen to draw given the existence of those red lines i understand why the european union believes that the deal agreed in november is the best which could be achieved ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:57:08+00:00,fm european nationals are not only very welcome in scotland they are crucial to our well being ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:57:08+00:00,fm it is an approach which is especially damaging to scotland without freedom of movement there is a danger that our population will start to decline we could face workforce shortages in rural areas in our universities in our care and health services ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:57:07+00:00,fm i spoke about french citizens in scotland earlier for me this is one of the saddest parts of brexit the uk government is proclaiming the end of free movement as a victory instead it is a self defeating measure it removes opportunity from millions of people ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:56:32+00:00,fm by insisting on an independent trade policy it effectively rules out a customs union it effectively rules out single market membership by explicitly committing to the ending of free of movement of people ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:56:32+00:00,fm and in the places where november s political declaration is clear it is damaging to scotland ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:56:06+00:00,fm it is impossible to be optimistic about the uk government s ability to agree a long term relationship which safeguards scotland s interests ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:56:06+00:00,fm that is deeply concerning if you look at the ongoing chaos at westminster where hardline brexiteers appear to receive more attention than moderate voices ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:56:06+00:00,fm perhaps even more fundamentally we still have virtually no clarity on what the uk s long term relationship with the eu will look like the uk parliament is effectively being asked to approve a blindfold brexit ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:55:23+00:00,fm putting that sector at a disadvantage will be damaging to scotland and indeed the whole of the uk and ultimately to member states across europe ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:55:22+00:00,fm to give one important example it seems clear that no free trade agreement envisaged by the uk government will match the benefits the single market provides for services however scotland s services sector accounts for three quarters of our economic output ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:55:22+00:00,fm let me be clear though that is a reflection of the uk government s flawed negotiating strategy rather than the position of the eu ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:55:22+00:00,fm now you will have noticed that the uk government s negotiating stance has not reflected any of the scottish government s views or proposals that is why we believe that the deal the prime minister agreed with the other eu member states in november is deeply flawed ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:54:28+00:00,fm we will always seek to be close allies and partners with our neighbours in europe the last two years to my mind have underlined the importance of that position ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:54:27+00:00,fm one thing i do want to stress however is that for the scottish government independence is not about the isolationism that characterises brexit instead independence would see us recognizing and embracing our interdependence with other nations ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:53:55+00:00,fm and finally we proposed that when there is greater clarity about the terms of brexit scotland must have the option to choose a different course by opting to become an independent country i will say more about independence at a future date ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:53:55+00:00,fm that option represented a middle ground given the closeness and complexity of the referendum result ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:53:55+00:00,fm however we also suggested that if this was not possible the uk as a whole should remain in the customs union and single market or even that scotland should retain single market membership as part of a differentiated solution ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:52:29+00:00,fm in this paper we made clear the scottish government s view that continued membership of the eu would be the best outcome for scotland and the uk ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:52:29+00:00,fm this paper was the first detailed set of brexit proposals to be produced by any government in the uk these proposals aimed to minimize the harm caused by brexit and they also tried to take account of the nature of the vote across the uk ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:52:28+00:00,fm the scottish government on behalf of the scottish people has consistently sought compromise in december we published scotland s place in europe ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:51:41+00:00,fm that approach has led to many of the difficulties it faces today i can understand europe and france s frustration with that in fact i share that frustration ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:51:40+00:00,fm instead it has sidelined moderate voices and chosen to draw self defeating red lines none of which flow directly or inevitably from the referendum result ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:51:40+00:00,fm despite that the uk government has been unwilling to recognise the complexity of the vote across the uk the of people overall who wanted to remain the remain votes in scotland and northern ireland and the fact that the uk is supposed to be a partnership of equals ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:51:40+00:00,fm in scotland s case per cent of those who voted chose to remain ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:51:39+00:00,fm as i m sure you all know in two of the four countries that constitute the uk england and wales voted to leave the eu but the other two scotland and northern ireland voted to remain in the eu ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:50:36+00:00,fm and the taoiseach s statement was striking to me because the solidarity the eu has shown with ireland since the eu referendum contrasts sharply with the uk government s attitude to scotland ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:50:25+00:00,fm it s a good example of the fact that for member states especially but not exclusively smaller ones eu membership can amplify not curtail national sovereignty ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:50:08+00:00,fm he said as a leader of a small country that is fully committed to the european union this solidarity resonates deeply in ireland but not just in ireland in all small member states as well ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:50:07+00:00,fm i was struck by something that the taoiseach leo varadkar said earlier this month he was reflecting on the consistent support ireland has received from the eu throughout the brexit process ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:49:27+00:00,fm i hope that scotland s base in paris in a small but significant way will help us to do that more effectively of course at the moment a key way in which we co operate with other countries is through the eu ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:49:09+00:00,fm and so participating in international institutions and speaking up for internationalist values is hugely important ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:48:50+00:00,fm we are being reminded at the moment that the principles they exemplify multilateralism cooperation a respect for human rights cannot be taken for granted we hear too many voices of intolerance and isolationism around the world today that should concern all of us ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:48:29+00:00,fm the institutions created during that time which of course include the predecessors to the european union have brought significant and lasting benefits to europe and to the world as a whole ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:48:29+00:00,fm it s a reminder that france was at the heart of efforts after world war ii to create a rules based international order ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:48:29+00:00,fm but another important reason to be based here is that paris as a great world city is the home to major international organisations unesco and the oecd in different forms have both been here since the s ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:47:19+00:00,fm there s actually a point here which goes slightly beyond brexit the main task of the scottish government s new paris hub is to strengthen our ties with france ,theSNP
2019-02-19 16:47:19+00:00,fm in addition to all of the practical benefits we gain from the eu we also cherish its fundamental values freedom democracy the rule of law equality and respect for human dignity and human rights and we will always encourage the eu to live up to these values ,theSNP
