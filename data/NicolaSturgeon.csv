2019-10-27 09:55:05+00:00, for the argument for election in more detail this is a good read there are undoubtedly pros and cons but assuming extension for jan secured the case for acting now is strong ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-27 09:51:45+00:00, to change the course johnson is taking us on we need to beat him i accept that challenge for in scotland other parties have to do the same elsewhere in uk doing nothing almost guarantees he gets what he wants brexit delivered possibly through no deal ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-27 09:51:15+00:00, for all his bluster johnson would much prefer to fight an election with brexit already delivered an election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his october do or die promise and also defend his bad deal ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-27 09:50:46+00:00, re a people s vote i ve strongly supported that and would vote for it but there s no evidence that the majority for it exists within this parliament and if there is an extension to jan the clock starts ticking again immediately we have no time to waste ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-27 09:50:21+00:00, a thread on our call for a general election firstly we have to ask ourselves what the alternative is doing nothing allows johnson to get his bad deal through with lab support or even worse run down clock to end january when no deal becomes a real risk all over again,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-24 17:12:14+00:00,so johnson appears to be saying to mps if you vote for an election i ll bring back my bad brexit bill and try to drag us out of the eu before we go to the polls elections should be exercises in letting voters decide not devices for charlatans to get their own way ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-24 09:23:12+00:00,this analysis is spot on imo ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-22 07:13:07+00:00,this is the so called protection for workers rights government must make a statement on whether or not a future bill erodes workers rights but even if it does they can still proceed no wonder is advising labour mps not to fall for it ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-21 16:55:52+00:00,we ve seen today that even the westminster brexit secretary hasn t yet grasped the details of this deal trying to ram through legislation of this complexity significance and long lasting consequences in just days is an abomination of scrutiny and democracy ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-21 12:43:11+00:00,seems ukg will try to ram withdrawal agreement bill through in days ignoring requirement of and to consider legislative consent motions recall would allow an opportunity but outrageous that vital scrutiny expected to happen in such short timescale ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-19 13:53:21+00:00,excellent johnson s losing run continues and more importantly his contradictory promises to the erg and labour rebels and his bad deal overall can be subjected to real scrutiny ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-19 13:04:28+00:00,the dishonesty of this is breathtaking the letwin amendment is a protection against the risk of no deal at this stage,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-19 09:45:05+00:00,johnson has broken virtually every past promise he has made on brexit how anyone could believe promises he makes now on workers rights or anything else is beyond me caveat emptor should be the words ringing in ears of any labour mp thinking of backing this deal ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-18 21:34:49+00:00,how can any labour mp believe promises from boris johnson on workers rights ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-18 17:03:27+00:00,scotland s competitive disadvantage from the deal in a nutshell ergo i d suggest it s not very good for the union at all ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-18 06:22:28+00:00,hope i m wrong but i have a real suspicion that labour would be quite happy to see this deal go through they will officially oppose but give nod to rebels to ensure numbers there to pass it will be the end of them in scotland if they do end up facilitating brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-17 16:38:21+00:00,taoiseach as a small nation i ve felt solidarity of other nations exactly why scotland should be independent in europe rather than continue to be treated with contempt by westminster ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-17 10:49:05+00:00, brexit has shown that the only way for scotland to be in charge of our own future is to become independent that why we must have next year,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-17 10:48:38+00:00, mps should not fall for a deal no deal framing no brexit revoke is always an alternative to no deal ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-17 10:47:39+00:00, for scotland this deal would take us out of eu single market and customs union all against our will it would leave us as only part of uk being taken out without consent and with no say on future relationship will not vote for that ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-10-17 10:46:15+00:00, seems to me that no one who voted against may s deal on basis it lacked strong enough assurances about closeness of future relationship could possibly vote for this much harder brexit beckons if this deal passes ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-10-11 14:53:38+00:00,a mandate for an independence referendum should be respected by westminster says welsh labour even though they oppose independence for wales makes it even more absurd that scottish labour refuses to support a position of such basic democracy ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-04-06 20:26:57+00:00,if the detail of this is true and i accept it is only an if labour will never be forgiven a deal that would see them vote for a tory brexit with a nod and a wink agreement to kill off a people s vote ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-04-06 08:09:23+00:00,thanks zofia it was lovely to meet you yesterday so glad you ve chosen to make scotland your home ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-05 16:39:01+00:00,this is similar to when i met pm on wednesday she wanted to know where we could compromise but refused to indicate any compromise she might make it is a bizarre approach from someone who made great play of wanting to find consensus and has just wasted yet more time ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-05 10:50:18+00:00,this is a really good piece by ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-05 09:13:04+00:00,my open letter to every eu national living in scotland as sets out practical support to help you stay here this is your home you are welcome here we value your contribution and we want you to stay ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-05 08:21:41+00:00,instead of decisive action requesting a long delay to allow the issue to go back to the people theresa may just proposes more short term ism and a new cliff edge ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-03 19:04:03+00:00,so sorry to hear this david thinking of you ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-03 13:40:28+00:00,just had a positive meeting with i d be surprised and very disappointed if labour sold out for such a bad deal ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-03 12:06:58+00:00,this is appalling and the mod is right to launch a full investigation ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-03 08:03:21+00:00,not all of it ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-03 05:34:27+00:00,great to see you safe trip home to shetland,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-02 19:02:07+00:00,only fair that i tweet sec of state response i hope he will back participating in euro elections so that we avoid a may cliff edge would also point out that voting for motion last night would have given insurance policy against no deal ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-02 18:10:39+00:00,if this is true it would suggest that on the question of whether we should crash out of the eu with no deal or seek an extension the secretary of state for scotland was undecided extraordinary ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-02 17:46:10+00:00,the sensible way forward and i think the one pm would take if this was a serious attempt to build consensus is agree to fight election seek longer delay and allow option of public vote on what commons agrees ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-02 17:41:49+00:00,this thread highlights a massive danger if mps allow april to pass with no commitment to fight euro elections may becomes the inescapable exit day and pm would then be able to say it s my deal or no deal parliament needs to be very wary about a potential trap ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-02 17:18:13+00:00,this does seem very much like pm kicking the can and yet again delaying making any decision that could break her cabinet what is missing is an answer from her to the question that many mps faced up to last night what is the compromise she is willing to make ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-02 08:00:12+00:00,this blog from explains why snp mps voted as we did last night we prioritised options that would stop brexit and remove the risk of a no deal exit but we also showed a willingness to compromise by voting for a single market customs unions option ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 17:20:58+00:00,this is an interesting and unsettling piece by ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 16:14:12+00:00,genuinely can t think of any good reason why labour mps would not vote for option tonight it provides an insurance policy against a no deal brexit and doesn t mean that article couldn t be triggered again in future if uk manages to work out what it wants ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 15:51:01+00:00,yay i m loving this thanks ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 12:50:11+00:00,really important to remember that tonight s votes are not on a preferential basis an snp vote for sm cu would only be to keep that option alive in case it later becomes only alternative to a harder brexit our preference is stopping brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 08:52:01+00:00,snp will decide votes when we see detail of what is selected later today s vote is not on a preferential basis so there may be an opportunity to keep alive least worst options against no deal hard brexit but to be clear our preference is not soft brexit it is no brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 08:14:34+00:00,today in scotland the new domestic abuse act comes into force free personal care is extended to the under s prescription charges rise to in england but remain without charge here as the uk government is consumed by brexit is getting on with the job ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-04-01 07:39:12+00:00,the most important motion laid today is this one from it makes revoking article rather than a no deal brexit the default option if parliament can t agree a way forward i hope all parties will support ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-31 18:57:39+00:00,thanks ryan hope you re good and see you soon x,NicolaSturgeon

2019-03-29 17:34:08+00:00,so while the tories say this about labour their attack line on the snp in scotland is that today s vote will cause a no deal brexit someone should tell them we can see all their tweets but just so they re in no doubt the snp is trying to stop brexit ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 15:09:27+00:00,we ll decide votes when we see options obvs but a customs union on its own is not a position we ve advocated because it would not protect scotland s interests the compromise we proposed only if remain not an option was full single market and customs union membership ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 14:52:03+00:00,third defeat for pm s bad deal she must now accept that it s dead the commons will now return on monday to find a way forward i hope that willl be to put the issue back to the people and or revoke article but will work with others to find the best option possible,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 13:26:27+00:00,this is spot on ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 12:14:27+00:00,this is excellent from politicians who rightly demand tougher targets on climate change can t just throw their hands up in horror at every difficult change that might be required to help meet those targets ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 11:27:47+00:00,this is a quite inspired frock choice by the wonderful today ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 10:27:54+00:00,if this is what happens labour will also be handing a blank cheque to whoever comes after may boris raab whoever it would take a lot of explaining let s hope the rumours are wrong ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 10:22:41+00:00,labour mps are not really about to save pm s skin and usher in a tory brexit are they ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-29 09:46:43+00:00,alert this shameless charlatan devoid of any principle whatsoever is on the loose might be accompanied by a pal called jacob ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-03-29 06:49:53+00:00,congratulations to new councillor for clacks central brilliant result ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-28 18:29:11+00:00, the story that emerges is of a process in which the eu moved inexorably forward as westminster collapsed into political infighting indecision and instability this is very good by though not a cheery read ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-28 17:41:32+00:00,i ll have a listen thanks ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-28 17:13:59+00:00,really good thread from for those interested on the legalities of separating withdrawal agreement and political declaration ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-28 17:03:15+00:00,part of the problem already with the withdrawal agreement and political declaration is that it means agreeing to leave the eu with no clarity about the future ie a blindfold brexit take away the pd completely and that problem is compounded why would mps agree to that ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-28 09:22:01+00:00,dear instead of talking about things that happened when i was eight years old how about showing some leadership today you could start by asking yourself why the polls show you still trailing behind the most incompetent tory government in our lifetimes ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-28 07:29:43+00:00,some nice non brexit news spring has sprung can t wait to start this at the weekend ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-27 21:05:54+00:00,the first preference of has always been to stop brexit if that s not possible and until relatively recently it seemed it wasn t we d opt for soft brexit over hard but stopping brexit is possible now and we voted tonight to give that the best chance ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-27 19:43:07+00:00,the erg position is nonsensical the backstop they worry will be permanent but might now vote for is more likely to be permanent if a new pm adopts their approach to the future eu relationship which if logic applies yes i know should make dup less likely to support now ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-27 17:37:00+00:00,if brexit ends up being forced through on the basis of a deal no one supports indeed a deal so bad that the pm has to promise to resign to get it through it will make an already bad project even worse ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-27 17:25:10+00:00,any mp who is serious about stopping a no deal brexit has to vote for amendment tonight it s as simple as that ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-27 11:26:50+00:00,this from is brilliant and moving ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-27 08:39:39+00:00,we didn t need the services of sherlock to work this out but still what an admission so many in labour must be tearing their hair out right now ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-25 16:31:23+00:00,last week the eu saw that the pm had no coherent or deliverable plan and decided to come up with one for her the commons must do the same tonight ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-25 16:17:05+00:00,and so say all of us ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-25 11:31:57+00:00,welcome great to have you on board ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-03-22 13:33:42+00:00,i ll be proud to speak at the march tomorrow scotland voted to remain in but people across the uk must have the chance to get out of this brexit mess whatever scotland s future i hope independent it is in all of our interests for uk to be in the eu ,NicolaSturgeon

2019-03-21 23:02:15+00:00,great to see you and thanks for all your work on the scottish national investment bank,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-21 21:50:03+00:00,so it seems the eu will give uk an extra two weeks to avoid a no deal brexit imperative now that parliament takes control away from pm and uses that time to agree a way forward preferably asking for a longer extension to put the issue back to voters ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-21 17:31:58+00:00,great to speak at earlier and take part in a discussion with the always inspiring is doing pioneering work helping position scotland as the place to be for data ethics and innovation ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-21 16:00:22+00:00,this is important macron is not ruling out a longer extension he is saying it would require deep political change at westminster and a great many people in the uk would agree that s exactly what s needed ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-21 14:37:38+00:00,it s impossible for any of us to comprehend the pain and anguish of alesha s family i just hope that in time they can draw some comfort from knowing so many are thinking of them and cherish the memories of the beautiful wee girl who graced their lives ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-21 14:05:41+00:00,an issue as big and important as brexit should not come down to petitions that said if you are frustrated that the pm is just not listening you can sign here ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-21 08:27:16+00:00,of course the logic of theresa may s assertion that parliament s indecision is frustrating the will of the people is to put the issue back to the people and let them decide if she is confident that the people back her what s stopping her ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-20 20:49:03+00:00,the one thing missing from that pointless pm speech was any acknowledgment of the massive responsibility she bears for this mess she could have changed course after the first defeat of her deal but she is still trying to force a choice between a bad deal and no deal shameful,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-20 19:01:14+00:00,this assessment of the prime minister may be brutal but it is also accurate and entirely justified ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-20 12:46:39+00:00,not sure why you are unenlightened been clear in our support for second eu referendum and general election would be fine with us too what can t continue is path to disaster that pm is on and if she won t change course she should go ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-20 12:14:32+00:00,about to chair a meeting of resilience committee preparing for the possibility of a no deal brexit only upside is that it saves me from and listening to this weak pm failing to stand up to the hardliners and risking no deal instead she needs to go ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-20 10:31:01+00:00,and the feeling grows that ultimately labour will be the handmaidens of a tory brexit i so want to be proved wrong on this in spite of the fact that it would be their political death knell in scotland ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-20 08:05:14+00:00,in a nutshell the question is how long the so called moderates in her own party are going to allow this pandering to the hardliners to continue ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-19 20:41:07+00:00,that s brilliant tell him i m very impressed ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-19 20:13:18+00:00,this is an important read for anyone who wants to understand just how complex the legal challenges not just the political ones are for the uk government in coming days ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-19 19:01:21+00:00,there are few things more exciting in the book world imo than a new ali smith novel and the early reviews of spring are glorious can t wait ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-19 12:10:30+00:00,and still the pm s choice is to pander to the hard brexiteers instead of trying to find a more inclusive way forward so utterly wrongheaded ,NicolaSturgeon
2019-03-19 11:07:25+00:00,great news that unemployment in scotland is at new record low of  below uk rate of ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-12-14 08:17:48+00:00,pm has tried credit to her for that but as expected the eu is not open to renegotiation it s time to stop this pretence bring the vote to parliament and then when the deal is rejected seek to bring majority behind a second eu vote anything else now is just wasting time ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-11-14 07:28:30+00:00,indeed pm s approach would take scotland out of the single market despite our remain vote but leave us competing for investment with northern ireland that is effectively still in it ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-11-13 18:44:44+00:00,also though the withdrawal proposals will get most attention initially the declaration on future relationship is just as important if that is vague and dodges tough issues a blindfold brexit would beckon it would be deeply irresponsible for parliament to sanction that ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-11-13 18:16:19+00:00,if the pm s deal satisfies no one and can t command a majority we mustn t fall for her spin that the uk crashing out of eu without a deal is then inevitable instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-06-07 17:34:27+00:00,the last para on the second page of this letter is gobsmacking according to the pm the choice the uk faces is between the unacceptable and the unpalatable it s long past time that she chose a different course ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-06-07 12:44:30+00:00,the depressing thing about this is that they see it just as an intra government game of chicken the interests of the country don t seem to matter a jot to them utterly shameful ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-06-07 12:32:38+00:00,this by is one of the most pathetic political interventions ever produces a film to promote diversity and welcome those who choose to come here from other countries and he gets all upset hope has the good grace to be embarrassed ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-06-02 15:53:14+00:00,i ve read and heard more people this week including no voters talking about and seriously considering the possibilities of independence than i have in some time that s a real tribute to the work of and the growth commission ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-06-02 15:37:32+00:00,and this in the is yet another example of the growth commission report re energising the debate about the possibilities of independence ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-06-02 15:35:52+00:00,i might not agree with every single word of this piece in today s times but it is another example of the positive re engagement with the arguments for independence since the publication of the growth commission report ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-06-02 13:21:22+00:00,had a great time as usual at the gorbals fair well done to this year s prince princess and their two courtiers ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-05-30 09:25:26+00:00,delighted to speak this morning about the massive opportunities ahead for scottish manufacturing ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:23:52+00:00, lastly policy choices in an independent scotland will always be for the government of the day so we should welcome debate but without independence these choices will always be far too limited that s the case we must win and helps us do it ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:21:13+00:00, so we have a choice stay as we are locked into the brexit spiral and continued austerity that the westminster parties offer no alternative to or decide to equip ourselves with the powers to build our way to a better future ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:18:27+00:00, but with the powers of independence and by following report s advice on how we can match the success of other small countries particularly its recommendations on population higher growth more revenue and increased prosperity and fairness is the attainable prize ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:17:16+00:00, the report s projections about deficit reduction are deliberately cautious they make no assumptions about higher growth and instead illustrate that even in worst case scenario independence is a better option that sticking with westminster system that created the deficit ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:16:31+00:00, report also stresses importance of investment to boost economy and that fiscal targets should not be at the expense of growth another sharp contrast with westminster indeed it recommends fiscal stimulus both in the independence transition and in periods of low growth ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:15:21+00:00, the report explicitly rejects austerity eg part b p scotland should explicitly reject the austerity model pursued by the u k in recent years and recommends above inflation spending growth each year a marked contrast to the failed westminster approach ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-30 09:14:26+00:00, reading lots of interesting comments about the which is good so much better to be discussing how to build a successful independent scotland than just resigning ourselves to managing the decline of brexit uk a few points worth underlining though ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-29 17:51:26+00:00,however i do very much agree with this line in the speech the nhs has dealt brilliantly with challenges over the last decade finding new ways to deliver and improve the standard of care maybe we ll hear tories acknowledge this a bit more in from now on ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-29 17:44:25+00:00,and yet when made progressive tax changes to help deliver more money for the nhs the tories opposed tooth and nail their actions speak louder than their empty words ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-28 13:32:06+00:00,you could say that ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-27 11:51:07+00:00,this young man student nurse former member of our youth parliament and one of many who carried the baton for glasgow  is surely a credit to scotland it is a disgrace that he faces deportation ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 17:54:44+00:00,paying homage to the late great philip roth this evening ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 17:20:25+00:00, congratulations to and the people of ireland compassion justice and trust in women win the day joyful moment but also one to remember the heartbreak for many along the way ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 16:21:47+00:00,equal marriage too would be nice to think we ll see progress there soon too ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 16:16:46+00:00,well this has made my day thanks nelly ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 12:09:42+00:00,this is well worth a read ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 11:50:59+00:00,he s right and yet scots tories oppose sensible plans to extend presumption against short sentences ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-26 09:16:54+00:00,it s yes predicts well done ireland ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-25 21:15:11+00:00,hope this is right ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-25 21:11:23+00:00,polls closed in ireland good luck to and all those who stood up for the rights of women ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-25 20:11:36+00:00,zadie smith on philip roth every word a treasure ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-25 15:41:25+00:00,it is fine that some people are talking about what they don t agree with in report as well as what they do because that means debate is focused on how to build a better country which is so much more constructive than despairing about brexit and westminster ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-05-25 15:06:36+00:00,for those who haven t read the report before commenting on it it recommends above inflation spending growth and explicitly rejects austerity if only we d had that in last few years look forward to debating all the recommendations over summer ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-01-24 10:03:03+00:00, now i ll leave those who are motivated to do so to argue about flags i ll get back to matters health education the economy and protecting scotland s interests ends ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 10:01:32+00:00, sadly the truth will not matter to some in today s media and that s part of a much bigger problem i m afraid but i still believe hope it matters to most in the media and certainly to the public ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 10:00:08+00:00, as for the claim that i ordered a change i have issued no instructions orders authorisations or even expressed an opinion about changing flag policy the update of the guidance was an administrative step albeit a sensible one and not done at my request ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 09:58:00+00:00, yes the civil service recently decided to update the published guidance but simply to ensure that it accurately reflected the long standing practice the underlying policy has not changed and why would it ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 09:56:27+00:00, since  the lion rampant has been flown on royal occasions entirely appropriately since the lion rampant is the royal banner it is not clear to me why anyone would object to that however the key point is that there has been no change to this since ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 09:54:26+00:00, there are two essential elements to the story one that has recently changed its practice on what flags to fly from government buildings on royal occasions and two that i ordered such a change both are wrong ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 09:52:53+00:00, since the truth doesn t seem to matter very much to some let me set out the facts on this ridiculous flag story ,NicolaSturgeon

2018-01-24 09:12:12+00:00,iain i m going to end this exchange as i think you probably understand quite well it just doesn t suit the story for you to say so the practice since is to fly the lion rampant ie the royal banner on royal occasions that hasn t changed and why would it ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 09:02:14+00:00,it s almost like you haven t bothered to read the replies i sent you yes the guidance was updated to accurately reflect existing policy you said i ordered a change in policy that s wrong on both counts there is no change in policy and i didn t order any such thing ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 08:32:34+00:00,yes ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 08:26:22+00:00, this update was a straightforward administrative task i did not ask for it to be done indeed i was not even aware it had been done until media enquiries made the facts were of course all stated in the scottish government response had you checked ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 08:24:24+00:00, it has been practice to fly lion rampant on royal occasions since  i have not ordered instructed authorized any change indeed there has been no change civil servants recently updated published guidance to reflect the long standing practice ,NicolaSturgeon
2018-01-24 07:58:32+00:00,i have done no such thing why are you repeating a blatant untruth ,NicolaSturgeon
