2019-08-19 16:00:12+00:00,the best way to stop no deal is not jeremy corbyn forcing people to make him pm because we know that won t succeed we need to pass a piece of legislation to extend article and hold a people s vote will jeremy corbyn back that ,joswinson
2019-08-19 15:58:59+00:00,mps from several parties have said they will not support jeremy corbyn as pm so we know he cannot command support in parliament if he is unwilling to get behind another candidate then he risks delivering the no deal brexit he claims he wants to stop ,joswinson

2019-08-16 17:17:20+00:00,increasingly clear that jeremy corbyn cannot command the confidence of the house as i said in my speech yesterday we should focus on plans that can work like a law to extend article or another candidate for pm ,joswinson

2018-07-20 08:03:24+00:00,the rich teas are to hand dont worry ,joswinson
2018-07-19 20:46:46+00:00,rather demonstrates what were up against let me guess did this chap ask to remain unnamed ,joswinson
2018-07-19 18:30:39+00:00,nor do i truth be told ,joswinson
2018-07-19 13:00:19+00:00,really darren who says sounds like rubbish to me breaking pairing is pretty much unheard of so your numbers look dodgy esp without a source ,joswinson
2018-07-19 12:56:19+00:00,well said kirsty the ignorance of some people about what caring for a newborn is actually like coupled with their willingness to pass judgement on others doing so is breathtaking ,joswinson
2018-07-19 11:50:46+00:00,not quite yet i was running at wks pregnant but wks post partum is pushing it ,joswinson
2018-07-19 11:39:02+00:00,thanks kate can you pls drop me an email with your details to jo swinson mp uk while im looking after my new baby my staff are doing an excellent job of taking up issues for constituents ,joswinson

2018-07-19 09:37:15+00:00,thanks martha it is something to behold ,joswinson
2018-07-19 09:22:20+00:00,well this reflects pretty badly on those peddling the honest mistake nonsense to be fair hats off to the two mps who told their chief whip to take a running jump when he asked them to break a pairing just because the govt might lose we still need proxy voting ,joswinson
2018-07-17 22:10:03+00:00,i cheered when the supreme court ruled on this it was a battle i fought hard but was frustratingly unable to win in govt,joswinson
2018-07-17 21:57:46+00:00,this has a useful description,joswinson
2018-07-17 21:34:56+00:00,really so what happened then take me through it ,joswinson
2018-07-17 21:00:20+00:00,it was neither honest nor a mistake literally not credible that of votes today brandon lewis forgot that he was paired for the crunch votes and those votes alone ,joswinson
2018-07-17 20:32:47+00:00,not into the chamber but pairing is supposed to mean someone from other side also doesnt vote so result unaffected but tonight shows why we need proxy voting ,joswinson
2018-07-17 19:42:43+00:00,enough of this instead of closing parliament early let the commons decide on proxy voting next week with binding motions and put an end to this charade ,joswinson
2018-07-17 19:36:55+00:00,  women lose their jobs each year in the uk due to pregnancy maternity discrimination despite claims to want to fight burning injustices govt response to this problem has been shockingly poor so perhaps it should be no surprise they treat mps on mat leave like this ,joswinson
2018-07-17 19:24:47+00:00,dont try any nonsense about a mistake this is calculated deliberate breaking of trust by govt whips to win at all costs brandon abstained in afternoon divisions but voted in the two crunch votes after pm theres a word for it cheating ,joswinson
2018-07-17 19:13:01+00:00,just how low will your govt stoop when delayed proxy voting motions she assured those of us who were pregnant that we would be paired when necessary today your govt broke that agreement paired with me but voted desperate stuff ,joswinson
2018-07-17 17:45:28+00:00,sadly house of commons votes  against nc on a free trade area and customs union with eu ,joswinson
2018-07-17 17:36:08+00:00,i would be too if it werent for the sleeping baby on me ,joswinson
2018-07-17 17:33:36+00:00,we had hoped proxy voting would be in place in time in its absence andrea promised the of us who pregnant at the time that we would be paired when we needed it ,joswinson
2018-07-17 17:30:00+00:00,  govt defeat on nc on european medicines agency does happy dance quietly ,joswinson
2018-07-17 17:25:09+00:00,it is we need proxy voting ,joswinson
2018-07-17 17:18:56+00:00,absolutely its very frustrating ,joswinson

2018-07-17 17:12:39+00:00,alas he started crying i picked him up and he went back to sleep but now theres a flaw in the tea drinking plan ,joswinson
2018-07-17 16:59:22+00:00,so if the govt is defeated on customs union new clause and other issues as i hope it will be ill have to cheer quietly today im paired with brandon lewis last night i was paired with margot james ,joswinson
2018-07-17 16:56:28+00:00,if this combination of a long feed bbc parliament on the telly doesnt make baby sleep for long enough for me to drink a whole cup of tea for once i dont know what will ,joswinson
2018-07-17 14:48:59+00:00,it may have been suspended for most im not certain but is certainly operational for those pregnant or on maternity leave we were given that assurance by the leader of the house when she told us the bad news about not bringing forward the motion to enable proxy voting ,joswinson
2018-07-16 21:00:50+00:00,looks bad ,joswinson
2018-07-16 16:46:59+00:00,mps choose how they want their name to appear in parliamentary documents,joswinson

2018-07-13 15:11:19+00:00,either way i want to look my children in the eye and say we stood up and were counted we said this is not normal this is not ok our liberal values are worth fighting for  ,joswinson
2018-07-13 15:09:31+00:00,in future we will look back at trump either as an appalling aberration or a pivotal departure from rules based international order objective facts valuing everyone as an individual and basic human decency  ,joswinson
2018-07-12 09:07:48+00:00,thats sad and i hope we can change it over time especially as moral support from fellow parents can be just what you need on those days where it alll goes wrong ,joswinson
2018-07-09 22:46:43+00:00,depends a lot on the minister often yes esp on less controversial matters ,joswinson
2018-07-09 20:59:54+00:00,yes i can see that logic but the damage to our national interest was real unacceptable ,joswinson
2018-07-09 20:46:45+00:00,government chaos generally pretty bad for the country but im so glad boris no longer foreign sec never shadowed anyone from any party who cared as little as he did about doing a good job and in one of the most important roles in govt may shouldve sacked him many times ,joswinson

2018-06-13 20:57:58+00:00,competition for most amusing tweets today snp outrage about mps abstaining yesterday on flawed clause as snp hoc leader absents himself from all of todays key brexit votes in a silly stunt guy mansplaining pregnancy to me its a joy amp sleep is for wimps ,joswinson
2018-06-13 19:35:44+00:00,once tonights brexit votes are finished prob in about an hour yes i will ,joswinson
2018-06-13 19:08:05+00:00,just voted to protect the uks place in the european economic area good to see some courageous labour mps defying their whip to do likewise but sadly not enough corbyn letting theresa may off the hook once again ,joswinson
2018-06-13 17:18:17+00:00,thanks kristin ,joswinson
2018-06-13 14:23:54+00:00,nope it wasnt a constituent asking for the record but an snp staffer pregnant or not mps cannot and should not be expected to be on duty  we are in all parties human beings and need sleep just like anyone else ,joswinson
2018-06-13 14:20:41+00:00,as it happens the hoc is considering introducing proxy voting for new parents but hasnt sorted it yet the of us who are pregnant are seeing the leader of the house this afternoon to urge speedier action ,joswinson
2018-06-13 11:23:42+00:00,its called the united kingdom and yes i care about people right across it pity but not surprising scottish nationalists dont seem to understand or maybe dont care beyond the border at gretna ,joswinson
2018-06-13 11:22:08+00:00,as you know graeme i made my support for keeping the uk together crystal clear at the ge last year and the voters elected me on that basis rejecting the snp ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:46:52+00:00,eh im in the same voting lobby as the snp most of the time you know so thats a bizarre accusation we took a different view on this particular amendment and ive explained why ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:35:33+00:00,some of us care about the whole of uk you suggesting scottish mps also shouldnt be fussed about impact of brexit on ni border issues ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:33:21+00:00,er so you think i also shouldnt be bothered about the impact of brexit on northern ireland because i dont represent a ni constituency ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:31:13+00:00,paul patience is a virtue as it happens i responded within hours of your pm tweet but frankly having spent hours voting yesterday while months pregnant im not going to apologise for prioritising rest for my baby over twitter replies to the snp last night ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:17:54+00:00,because i care about devolution across the whole of the uk,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:16:54+00:00,thanks abigail and for your contribution to it ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:16:09+00:00,well we do agree that the amount of time for the debate was farcical not the speakers fault to be fair this was set out in the govt programme motion which i voted against but which passed by i think votes ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:12:19+00:00,sure patricia on this vote i abstained as described below ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:11:27+00:00,imagine my surprise that an snp staffer is annoyed that i didnt vote with the snp on this ,joswinson
2018-06-13 07:09:29+00:00,sure didnt want to vote for it as scot parl didnt want it but voting against would have meant denying welsh assembly what they did want ,joswinson
2018-06-12 19:10:57+00:00,good on you theres lots of support available and we are always encouraging new talented candidates to come forward ,joswinson
2018-06-12 17:31:56+00:00,this has only been case since  a combination of indyref aftermath and fptp voting system plus decline of scot lab but in we went from mp to and have more targets in our sights for next time so glad youre on board see you at an or on campaign trail ,joswinson
2018-06-12 17:26:24+00:00,quite ,joswinson
2018-06-12 09:39:30+00:00,i now have another reason to resist the whole alexa thing i prefer my tech where judiciously placed remotes on high shelves or passcode protected ipads retain some semblance of parental control so far anyway ,joswinson
2018-06-12 08:53:56+00:00,bravo a principled decision with the countrys best interests at heart ,joswinson
2018-06-12 08:23:23+00:00,spot the difference in todays sun splash north and south of the border yes thats right the scottish editor rightly balked at using a nessie pic to represent scotland h t ,joswinson
2018-06-12 08:07:30+00:00,quite right anna ,joswinson
2018-06-12 07:48:24+00:00,such reassuring and wise words and timely as baby due any day now though hopefully after this weeks key brexit votes fingers and legs crossed ,joswinson
2018-06-12 07:41:01+00:00,it will include the employer having to publish a statement about wider ways they support parents in the workplace e g flex working etc though some of what you describe is already illegal ,joswinson
2018-06-11 09:49:31+00:00,important research from on dads experiences of maternity services some good news two thirds felt welcome at birth but scotlands hospitals even worse than englands for letting dads stay overnight after birth must improve dads matter from the very start ,joswinson
2018-06-11 07:06:04+00:00,this is worthy of ,joswinson
2018-06-10 22:45:25+00:00,such good news ,joswinson
2018-06-10 13:19:59+00:00,thanks jeannot happy to do so can you plls drop me an email so i can let you know how i get on jo swinson mp uk,joswinson
2018-06-10 09:55:38+00:00,parents of small children everywhere know this feeling a yos sense of timing priceless ,joswinson
2018-06-10 09:33:25+00:00,hats off to mr sanchez for his leadership on gender equality at the top following sturgeon trudeau macron it is possible but how can we fasttrack this elsewhere ,joswinson
2018-06-10 00:24:42+00:00,looks appalling some useful info here from the council about what they are doing,joswinson
2018-06-09 10:56:04+00:00,the identity of the fruit shop priceless ,joswinson
2018-06-08 20:27:28+00:00,memory of a year ago knocking on doors in auchinairn in torrential rain persuading voters to the polls at the last minute gave one lady a lift to polling station in her dressing gown then in car at pm heard exit poll before getting curry from ashoka bearsden ,joswinson
2018-06-08 20:22:32+00:00,brought up in milngavie live in bearsden office in bishopbriggs ,joswinson
2018-06-08 20:20:15+00:00,you cant complain about it being wrong at least ,joswinson
2018-06-08 18:00:40+00:00,one year on since thank you to everyone in east dunbartonshire who put their trust in me to serve again as your local mp heres some thoughts on the last year ,joswinson
2018-06-08 16:50:18+00:00,looks like a fascinating event next week in glasgow about the future for science and impact of brexit ,joswinson
2018-06-08 13:41:37+00:00,no need for the sarcasm martin but thanks for sharing a lovely story dads rock ,joswinson
2018-06-08 13:27:32+00:00,im not a lawyer but know the hoc clerks do a good job of keeping things in order via their advice incl to the speaker so im pretty confident it can go ahead ,joswinson
2018-06-07 19:59:37+00:00,good to challenge it and when published in black and white for all to see employers may have to think that but harder about such discrepancies ,joswinson
2018-06-07 13:20:01+00:00,really useful research ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:39:03+00:00,i completely agree ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:38:02+00:00,very true culture plays a massive role leadership is key ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:29:57+00:00,id certainly encourage all sizes of employer to do this though figured easier to enforce this way with same threshold as for for gender pay reporting if they publish their pay gap this info should also be there ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:27:52+00:00,i know in govt i pushed this incl getting civil service to equalise pay and unsurprisingly those who enhance shppay see much higher spl uptake  etc but many havent really thought about it so far transparency will force them to consider ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:23:04+00:00,interesting piece of case law here full yr on salary is undoubtedly generous amp it is easy to see how this could be impossible for a company to continue if forced to extend that from to of its workforce theres a debate to be had for sure ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:18:58+00:00,there is technically a different legal base for the different types of leave even though both parents can take early on and or together there are certainly some physical experiences that differ and specific protections needed for the health of new mothers ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:14:04+00:00,i agree thats more likely but still contact them they need to understand the consequences of betraying the next generation ,joswinson
2018-06-07 12:09:54+00:00,contact her anyway ,joswinson
2018-06-07 11:12:50+00:00,it is of course illegal to pay men and women different rates of shared parental pay women also take spl if they are using the flexibility to take chunks of leave rather than all in one block ,joswinson
2018-06-07 11:06:42+00:00, in practical terms wld not want to encourage employers to level down esp in cases of v generous maternity packages offered in male dominated industries to attract more women e g ford traditionally have done this not helpful for individuals nor for building support for spl ,joswinson
2018-06-07 11:04:27+00:00,agree certainly desirable for pay to be aligned for both to answer your why question though theres reasons different legal basis for mat leave v spl one is for recovery from pregnancy birth and to enable establishment of breastfeeding as well as parental bonding etc,joswinson
2018-06-07 07:29:23+00:00,that would also be very interesting to know though not as straightforward to measure and publish and my aim is to keep this bill simple ,joswinson
2018-06-07 07:27:32+00:00,the only target im proposing here is that they have to publish on their website what their policy is even if it is simply the statutory minimum with no enhancement its helpful info for people to know for all the reasons outlined having to ask is fraught with problems ,joswinson
2018-06-07 05:55:41+00:00,next week is crunch time labour votes in hoc will decide whether the govt is forced to negotiate to keep uk in eea if you have a labour mp or are a labour voter make your views clear by tuesday will labour let the tories off the hook again ,joswinson
2018-06-06 22:14:34+00:00,thanks kristin yes it should be the review this year is a good hook to tie in the wider issue of pat pay for self employed fathers and a cause have been championing ,joswinson
2018-06-06 22:05:14+00:00,how so all this does is give people the info they need to make informed decisions about where they apply to work up to them to choose and indeed for employers to choose what to offer they would just have to be transparent about it ,joswinson
2018-06-06 21:34:59+00:00,want to know more read my piece and then please contact your mp to ask them to back my bill  ,joswinson
2018-06-06 21:32:14+00:00,my bill proposes a simple light touch regulatory change that would have significant benefits for both employers and employees  ,joswinson
2018-06-06 21:30:58+00:00,if were serious about building fairer workplaces then employers must be open and upfront about how they support parents with their pay and leave policies dinosaur attitudes about not hiring people who might have children have no place in the st century  ,joswinson
2018-06-06 21:27:55+00:00,its therefore not surprising that many men say they are concerned that their careers could be negatively affected if they take shared parental leave  ,joswinson
2018-06-06 21:25:04+00:00,prospective employees shouldnt have to ask during recruitment to find out key information about parental pay policies especially when we know that  women in britain lose their jobs each year as a result of pregnancy and maternity discrimination  ,joswinson
2018-06-06 21:19:22+00:00,today in the house of commons i introduced my parental leave and pay arrangements publication bill to require large employers to publish the details of how they support working parents in terms of maternity paternity adoption and shared parental leave and pay  ,joswinson
2018-06-06 18:03:11+00:00,great stuff thanks though worth noting for full accuracy that the majority of those are eligible for maternity allowance at the same rate as stat maternity pay only the have no eligibility for paid leave and some of those are not working at all ,joswinson
2018-06-06 09:28:12+00:00,thanks ,joswinson
2018-06-06 08:55:03+00:00,yes my intention is for the applicability to be the same as gender pay gap reporting orgs with employees for ease of identification though obv encourage smaller ones to publish too ,joswinson
2018-06-06 06:35:19+00:00,thanks gerry i agree if you drop me an email to jo swinson mp uk i can send you a little more detail ,joswinson
2018-06-05 16:52:08+00:00,shocked to hear the tragic news that a young worker has died after a fall at bearsden station my thoughts are with his loved ones a full and prompt investigation is essential to learn lessons people have a right to expect safety at work ,joswinson
2018-06-05 15:00:17+00:00,well done and the answer is yes if theyre anything like hansard reporters ,joswinson
2018-06-05 14:57:08+00:00,yes vickie and just made an intervention that this should be treated as a medical healthcare issue not one of policing ,joswinson
2018-06-04 11:54:43+00:00,ill just have to not look at that gorgeous picture oxytocin rushes could have consequences at this stage ,joswinson
2018-06-04 10:38:24+00:00,is there a lovelier sight than peacefully sleeping children esp if theyre yours ,joswinson
2018-06-04 10:24:59+00:00,certainly to get it reduced i dont think anyone has an issue when its minimal or unrelated to body shape size perfection etc but too often it just creates reinforces damaging stereotypes of an ideal look ,joswinson
2018-06-03 23:05:49+00:00,oh dear glad you fell backwards not forwards had a slip myself on the ice in march and was never so glad to have a bruised behind ,joswinson
2018-06-03 12:33:57+00:00,from my own family i know the pain caused by cardiac problems in young people today i pledge to establish a national strategy to prevent to help save young lives ,joswinson
2018-06-03 09:39:48+00:00,of course they will try to block but we have to use this chance for change interim measures could be put in place or it could be the royal colleges equivalent creating medical guidance instead of govt there is a way through ,joswinson
2018-06-03 09:32:58+00:00, th anniversary is iron so serve it with some cold roast beef and job done ,joswinson
2018-06-03 09:25:50+00:00,language matters great article on the change from chelsea ladies fc to chelsea fc women you wouldnt say a strong independent lady well worth a read h t ,joswinson
2018-06-03 09:20:43+00:00,this is suggesting repealing key clauses of oapa so requiring medical regulations in place of criminalisation such regs would as a health devolved matter be drawn up by relevant bodies in each country ,joswinson
2018-06-03 09:14:19+00:00,certainly lots of toilet trips ,joswinson
2018-06-03 08:53:44+00:00,passed through cumbria en route ,joswinson
2018-06-03 08:11:30+00:00,there were a few yes ,joswinson

2018-06-02 18:17:20+00:00,an excellent wks activity ,joswinson
2018-06-02 14:10:27+00:00,that feeling when you successfully complete a hour train journey at weeks pregnant without going into labour ,joswinson
2018-06-02 11:45:28+00:00,spectrum zx k loved the almost furry buttons,joswinson
2018-05-31 16:54:13+00:00,four fifths in fact ,joswinson
2018-05-31 16:00:40+00:00,they can hardly argue that all the good women had been snapped up this time can they ,joswinson
2018-05-31 10:45:12+00:00,feeling old ,joswinson
2018-05-31 10:42:13+00:00,fascinating that the relatively recent films phantom menace etc score worse than s originals,joswinson
2018-05-30 20:40:18+00:00,apparently then mine is things can only get better ,joswinson
2018-05-29 20:39:09+00:00,what a horrific attack thoughts are with the victims and their families who have lost those dear to them the uk must stand shoulder to shoulder with belgium and offer any support we can ,joswinson
2018-05-28 14:30:18+00:00,it certainly needs to be sorted sadly much employment law does not technically apply to mps as office holders instead of workers or employees ,joswinson
2018-05-28 12:45:06+00:00, mine annoyingly does the opposite far too often ,joswinson
2018-05-28 11:29:33+00:00,not sure celebrate is the right verb ,joswinson
2018-05-27 19:09:03+00:00,worth celebrating nonetheless a yellow pom pom was recently expelled from our little ones nose at least he was on message with the colour ,joswinson
2018-05-27 12:04:03+00:00,quite that article inspired me to do a whole conference speech on feminism ,joswinson
2018-05-27 09:31:36+00:00, you certainly wouldnt want that blog agreeing with you ,joswinson
2018-05-26 15:50:41+00:00,not by the age of anyway ,joswinson
2018-05-26 15:44:52+00:00,aches are ok good even i often like that reminder of a workout but any acute pain is a sign to take a break ,joswinson
2018-05-26 12:15:54+00:00, really well done caron im also pretty slow at the moment but it still feels good thats what is important not your speed often feels especially good afterwards ,joswinson
2018-05-25 21:36:21+00:00,yes but how many can you feasibly use speaking as someone who had a bit of a pregnancy cheesecake craving ,joswinson
2018-05-25 21:35:12+00:00, is generous i think ,joswinson
2018-05-25 21:34:44+00:00,quite right a regular bone of contention in the swinson hames household ,joswinson
2018-05-25 10:41:20+00:00,dont keep us in suspense ,joswinson
2018-05-25 10:36:04+00:00,eleanor thanks for getting in touch best way to look into this properly is if you file a formal complaint please provide us with as much info as poss including links screenshots of posts youre referring to thanks jo,joswinson

2018-05-24 21:11:38+00:00,must be possible ,joswinson
2018-05-24 17:11:50+00:00,sure esp re levels of police violence but still significant differences in how people are treated depending on their skin colour ,joswinson
2018-05-24 17:09:22+00:00,or more accurately this logic was first applied to indyref in the run up to and then to brexit campaign didnt make sense then doesnt make sense now ,joswinson
2018-05-24 15:46:10+00:00,absolutely agree with key brexit votes looming and just over weeks until im due id like hoc to deliver this change asap babies in the voting lobby are one thing contractions would be quite another ,joswinson
2018-05-24 15:32:43+00:00,i didnt say it ever was under trump surely now though our govt should recognise that ,joswinson
2018-05-24 15:22:28+00:00,disappointed that trump has pulled out of north korea summit first the iran nuclear deal now this impossible to trust us foreign policy to be rational anymore govt must recognise this erratic behaviour be realistic about chances of getting a good us trade deal post brexit ,joswinson
2018-05-24 11:42:00+00:00,this is just one utterly compelling example of why ireland needs to sending love and hope to irish sisters ,joswinson

2018-05-21 19:00:51+00:00, the solution to misogynist crimes isn t to ensure that violent men have sexual access to women it s that we teach men that they re not entitled to women s sexual attention to begin with well said ,joswinson

2018-04-11 08:52:41+00:00,one for you i think ,joswinson
2018-04-10 20:50:56+00:00,enjoy i can recommend the haggis if you make a trip to the buffet car ,joswinson
2018-04-09 20:37:43+00:00,nothing like a deadline thanks for your kind feedback ,joswinson
2018-04-09 12:02:50+00:00,indeed in fact theres a taboo about so many experiences of the female body so many issues are under discussed periods birth miscarriage menopause,joswinson
2018-04-09 08:18:39+00:00,devastating reports images point to a heartless inhumane illegal chemical attack by assads forces killing innocent syrian civilians intl community must unequivocally condemn this vicious act un must have access to gather evidence to hold those responsible to account ,joswinson
2018-04-08 14:27:32+00:00,brilliant column on why we should talk about birth it was the biggest most profound painful traumatic bizarre thing i d experienced in my life but there s a cautiousness in what we re encouraged to share ,joswinson
2018-04-07 21:40:43+00:00,the problem at the heart of data scandals the abusive business model of surveillance capitalism a great read ,joswinson
2018-04-07 10:45:13+00:00,delighted to see this all the best with it ,joswinson
2018-04-07 09:57:33+00:00,read the article employers are waking up to a problem they were blind to before that is significant progress though we need to keep up pressure for action for the record i won the fight for this law in  before id even thought of writing ,joswinson
2018-04-07 09:55:28+00:00,i disagree my colleagues and i are working hard for an yet there are simultaneously other problems that also need political attention ,joswinson
2018-04-07 07:35:28+00:00,these leaked quotes from cnn bosses perfectly sum up why i fought so hard to make gender pay gap reporting happen without hard data gender inequality is often invisible or ignored use the numbers ask questions of your employer ,joswinson
2018-04-06 21:50:12+00:00,this is excellent from on the value of impartial media outlets that aim for objective reporting even when that enrages both sides ,joswinson
2018-04-05 08:37:28+00:00,actually there is plenty of evidence of bias in recruitment overt discrimination and so on as matt says you may want to take a look at equal power to explore the issue more thoroughly esp the chapter on work ,joswinson
2018-04-04 19:17:13+00:00,govt departments have been publishing for a while and the parliaments will also have to as surely employ  though technically mps etc are office holders not employees ,joswinson
2018-04-04 18:50:49+00:00,they dont volunteer what their bonus gap is excluding secretaries though do they ,joswinson
2018-04-04 16:33:25+00:00,when this privilege is shared equally by men and women then it will be irrelevant to the gender pay gap in the meantime im stunned by the silence of men arguing for equal access to caring for their loved ones ,joswinson
2018-04-04 09:55:03+00:00,sending love and beauty to drown out the bile ,joswinson
2018-04-03 22:49:18+00:00,not directly but the difficulties changing the workplace to better fit those with caring responsibilities is partly due to gendered split of roles so how companies facilitate mens role as fathers has a key bearing on wider workplace equality ,joswinson
2018-04-03 22:46:39+00:00,its a damn good thing that we now have more searching questions asked by employees customers and employers themselves in place of warm platitudes and complacency ,joswinson
2018-04-03 22:37:59+00:00,ill bet its not without actual effort gender equality doesnt tend to just happen when societys default for so many things e g experts is male ,joswinson
2018-04-03 21:05:12+00:00,useful practical info here to do a bit of a data detox ,joswinson
2018-04-03 17:49:11+00:00,i can take it but thanks david sometimes sadly necessary to demonstrate the attitudes were still up against ,joswinson
2018-04-03 17:47:27+00:00,reported it ,joswinson

2018-04-03 15:00:03+00:00,so sad ,joswinson
2018-04-03 11:51:16+00:00,glad youre committed to tackling this what is the shared parental pay policy ,joswinson
2018-04-03 10:53:13+00:00,cheers pearl ,joswinson
2018-04-03 10:46:18+00:00,thanks stavros ,joswinson
2018-04-03 10:45:40+00:00,thanks stefan ,joswinson
2018-04-03 10:45:12+00:00,cross party effort from  working together gets results ,joswinson
2018-04-03 08:48:15+00:00,it always starts tomorrow ,joswinson
2018-04-03 08:44:11+00:00,if i lose my seat for standing up for the rights of a terrified year old girl so be it but i have confidence that the majority of people in east dunbartonshire also reject hate against people based on their faith ,joswinson
2018-04-03 08:38:44+00:00,this is not a competition everyone has a right to go about their daily business without fear i support the million eu citizens too and recently spoke at the conference organised by some of them ,joswinson
2018-04-03 08:13:54+00:00,i received this text from a friend last night a year old girl afraid to go outside just because of her faith the impact of rising bigotry in our country is heart breaking sending love to muslim friends and fellow citizens today ,joswinson
2018-04-03 07:39:26+00:00,reported ,joswinson
2018-04-02 16:42:23+00:00,ill just add that in my book equal power i bust the myth that gender inequality is just the product of peoples life choices ,joswinson
2018-04-02 15:00:42+00:00,looking after children domestic work caring for elderly relatives etc etc,joswinson
2018-04-02 10:28:54+00:00,but im not suggesting that the gender pay gap is entirely down to gendered wage discrimination the beauty of the data is that it captures much wider societal structural gender inequalities that employers should also be doing their bit to address ,joswinson
2018-04-02 10:26:30+00:00,that is illegal and govt ought to be cracking down hard on that this is about equal pay but not only about equal pay many employers who do pay equally still have a gpg ,joswinson
2018-04-02 10:19:44+00:00,if we all use this transparency to put pressure on them they are more likely to take action ,joswinson
2018-04-02 10:19:00+00:00,fascinating analysis thank you for doing this it shows there is no room for the complacency which is all too easy ,joswinson
2018-04-02 10:15:37+00:00,parenting domestic chores caring for relatives im not suggesting this should be in earnings but it is relevant info and as i explained the earnings gap is higher than gpg data makes it look ,joswinson
2018-04-02 10:13:31+00:00,delighted to support a cross party campaign to encourage people to check out their organisations gender pay gap and ask what steps their employer is taking to close it in action ,joswinson
2018-04-02 09:58:42+00:00,of course the pay gap stats actually under estimate the actual earnings gap as they are based on hourly pay when you factor in the number of paid hours worked the gender income gap is much bigger unpaid work is still largely uncaptured ignored in official stats ,joswinson
2018-04-02 09:09:26+00:00,why not try it it would be fascinating ,joswinson
2018-04-01 21:30:44+00:00,simultaneously impressed and a little freaked out by this ,joswinson
2018-04-01 13:21:28+00:00,good stuff yes sometimes the pain goes once you warm up and its ok sometimes it persists and its just your body telling you to stop working out the difference is key so physio sounds a good idea well impressed that youre doing this ,joswinson
2018-04-01 13:20:03+00:00,enjoy ,joswinson
2018-04-01 13:18:13+00:00,keep going nearly there ,joswinson
2018-04-01 10:15:12+00:00,quite which means we need to start at birth given the constraints on choice of our cultural expectations see the childhood chapter of my book ,joswinson
2018-04-01 10:09:19+00:00,good on you a picture to help cheer you up ,joswinson
2018-04-01 10:01:24+00:00,oh no your hip pain sounds bad be careful in case running on it makes it worse listen to your body and whatever you do lots of chocolate later ,joswinson
2018-04-01 09:57:38+00:00,indeed bill though that concentration of women in low paid occupations needs unpicking for cause effect given women are outperforming men in education when more women go into an industry the pay goes down ,joswinson
2018-04-01 09:50:06+00:00,so sorry to hear that i would definitely encourage you to email your mp to see if they can assist in any way with your immediate problems appreciate theres also the wider issue ,joswinson
2018-04-01 09:48:26+00:00,indeed i first started campaigning on excess packaging a decade ago its depressing how little progress has been made in that time ,joswinson
2018-03-31 21:58:29+00:00,seriously do think about it happy to answer any qs you have if you dm me ,joswinson
2018-03-31 20:05:55+00:00,indeed i mention the even bigger bonus gap in the article though obv not all employers have bonuses ,joswinson
2018-03-31 19:29:04+00:00,the fact is there is a gender pay gap unequal pay is part but not all of this gap thought id clarify as it seemed you were labouring under some misunderstanding about it ,joswinson
2018-03-31 19:26:32+00:00,im advocating closing the gender pay gap as well as equal pay they are not the same thing see the article ,joswinson
2018-03-31 19:13:55+00:00, the generic lame defence men women are paid the same for doing the same job memo to business leaders there will be no medals for complying with equal pay laws that have been in place for almost yrs equal pay is necessary but not sufficient ,joswinson
2018-03-31 18:54:39+00:00,spot on esp this we need to question why we view caring roles as predominantly undertaken by women and as less valuable than more male dominated roles under valuing care is a major problem and very relevant to the debate on automation and skills rebalancing too ,joswinson
2018-03-31 18:40:50+00:00,everyone is an individual and deserves the chance to thrive as their own unique self whatever their gender identity i support in the hope that we can create a society where all have this opportunity ,joswinson
2018-03-31 18:30:30+00:00,he really is going the extra mile or miles in days to be precise and for such an important cause the work samh does for mental heath is vital do sponsor willie if you can ,joswinson
2018-03-31 13:34:47+00:00,it was one of several qs tabled to build a more accurate picture ,joswinson
2018-03-31 08:00:02+00:00,that this was aired in a meeting without challenge and then that someone sat and typed that into minutes and that no one reading them was shocked and appalled enough to demand they are changed speaks volumes about how ingrained this must be ,joswinson
2018-03-31 07:55:27+00:00,welcome maggie ,joswinson
2018-03-30 20:24:45+00:00,thats the point the info has to be signed off by a senior director yet the accuracy levels lets just say vary ,joswinson
2018-03-30 19:56:07+00:00,its a fair point that eggs with thicker chocolate are less environmentally damaging ounce for ounce plus more chocolate ,joswinson
2018-03-30 19:51:56+00:00,thankfully it is possible to be concerned about plastic waste in the oceans poverty and housing at the same time,joswinson
2018-03-30 19:50:07+00:00,thanks katy suffice to say im pretty certain were on the same page was just confused as i thought the laura dale thread was brilliant hence sharing it then worried id missed something which i recognised was very possible reassured thats not the case though ,joswinson
2018-03-30 09:41:59+00:00,now im intrigued can you elaborate asking in genuine spirit of learning ,joswinson
2018-03-30 09:20:46+00:00,fascinating trial on improving productivity,joswinson
2018-03-30 07:20:41+00:00, no one should be seen as sexually available to anyone they dont want to be just as straight people can be cis or trans so can lesbians and bisexuals be lesbians arent attracted to all women in the same way straight women arent attracted to all men ,joswinson
2018-03-29 21:31:00+00:00,here you go ,joswinson
2018-03-29 21:29:47+00:00,people can be attracted or not to whoever they like for whatever reason they like summed up well in this thread ,joswinson

2018-03-28 10:58:35+00:00,gender is recognised by the united nations as relevant to both the impact of and our response to climate change for good reason just because people mocked the story does not mean there is nothing to be learned by considering gender in the debate ,joswinson
2018-03-28 10:45:06+00:00,the link between gender and poverty is relevant to vulnerability and resilience to economic shocks and yes climate change too ,joswinson
2018-03-28 05:28:43+00:00,thanks stevie ,joswinson
2018-03-27 17:15:42+00:00,its always especially good to hear from my youngest constituents ,joswinson

2018-03-26 21:25:38+00:00,yup ,joswinson
2018-03-26 21:20:04+00:00,when you get last minute notice that nursery are having an easter bonnet parade then realise well miss it as travelling back to the constituency no bonnet making required ,joswinson

2018-03-25 21:45:55+00:00,not really new when i called for this three weeks ago in a national newspaper ,joswinson
2018-03-25 10:26:30+00:00,to be fair to the festival organisers  is a big improvement on the publication stats but good to keep the scrutiny pressure on ,joswinson

2018-03-22 19:55:07+00:00,i dont suggest gpg reporting should be the limit of transparency nor is it a panacea just one of many tools id like to see used to drive equality ,joswinson
2018-03-22 12:19:50+00:00,good on you this should not rest here hope adam can help you ,joswinson
2018-03-22 11:57:05+00:00,no we never need to accept racism or xenophobia but we should recognise many leave voters made their choice without either of those im talking about how we reach out to voters not politicians who mislead and stoke fear ,joswinson
2018-03-22 11:52:18+00:00,i completely agree regs should have been stronger worth revisiting but we can also now use what we have to push companies to act ,joswinson
2018-03-22 11:50:48+00:00,brilliant elliot ,joswinson
2018-03-22 10:05:05+00:00,do you understand the word majority ,joswinson
2018-03-22 09:53:17+00:00, companies are absolutely shitting themselves about how their employees are going to react good about time many business leaders faced up to the hard figures made concrete plans instead of just issuing platitudes and glossy brochures on gender equality in the workplace ,joswinson
2018-03-21 19:02:07+00:00,thats news to me in what year do you claim that happened ,joswinson
2018-03-21 12:28:14+00:00,glad to see such a fitting tribute jo cox memorial grants for organisations working to promote womens empowerment and prevent identity based violence applications open april ,joswinson
2018-03-21 12:13:08+00:00,i agree with you on much of that but it doesnt find m we need to protect jobs and local services ,joswinson
2018-03-21 12:10:37+00:00,indeed snp have stifled local govt for a decade not least with their lengthy council tax freeze preparation for this budget should have been ongoing for months local snp were asleep at the wheel meaning cross party group had only weeks to figure out a plan ,joswinson
2018-03-21 11:56:47+00:00,how would you describe a govt settlement that leaves the council having to find m of cuts ,joswinson
2018-03-21 11:54:33+00:00, continually is absolute nonsense if you think otherwise name me just examples snp ran away from responsibility after their govt put council in position of needing to find m of cuts what would you cut ,joswinson
2018-03-21 11:28:25+00:00,continually go on then give me three examples ,joswinson
2018-03-21 11:24:52+00:00, just rted your pinned tweet on this,joswinson
2018-03-21 08:28:33+00:00,the snp ran away from responsibility at the first sign of difficulty despite winning most seats on edc they refused to govern and left the council totally unprepared for the budget to address the snp govts savage cuts ,joswinson
2018-03-21 07:56:31+00:00,seconded twitter would be a poorer place without you your fabulous images ,joswinson

2018-03-13 20:37:41+00:00,i didnt claim it was necessarily related but coincidence is interesting when us pres spokes refused to talk about russia in her briefing in this regard and reaction from us to russian attack here certainly shows how meaningless special relationship currently is ,joswinson
2018-03-13 20:34:21+00:00,i dont consider that to be misandrous language nor do i think its misogynistic to say as a woman depending on context sometimes specifically referencing gender is sexist but not always by any means ,joswinson

2018-03-07 12:42:34+00:00, part of my point look im not saying everyone has to agree with me on the statue but the ensuing debate has proven that there are many people not you who are incapable of separating their strong feelings about thatcher from misogyny ,joswinson
2018-03-07 12:30:35+00:00,true rhiannon but he is perfectly demonstrating part of my point ,joswinson

2018-03-07 12:13:16+00:00,heather you have very obviously not read my piece my whole point is about having many more statues of lots of women expanding out from the original question i was asked on qt in grantham thatchers birthplace ,joswinson
2018-03-07 12:10:29+00:00,thatll be because its not true ,joswinson
2018-03-07 11:53:34+00:00,this kind of nuanced insightful journalism is exactly what we need to make the most of gender pay gap reporting and use it to ask the right questions of employers bravo ,joswinson
2018-03-07 00:26:57+00:00,so sad to hear this well done for speaking out taking the harasser on its never easy im glad you have also had lots of support which i hope dwarfs the awful disrespect shown to you today ,joswinson
2018-03-06 23:25:03+00:00,i didnt even say it was the key driver talked about a whiff of it using it as a reason to demonise her some more i e additionally some peoples comments about her are pretty overtly misogynistic though ,joswinson

2018-03-06 13:16:11+00:00,fair enough to disagree but did you read what i actually wrote ,joswinson
2018-03-06 00:50:25+00:00,of course it doesnt ruth but you just managed to make your point perfectly reasonably without calling her a witch some havent been able to do that hence my tweet ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:58:20+00:00,bethan i dont need anyone to advise me that witch is a gendered sexist insult that has no place in political debate its perfectly easy to criticise thatchers record as i did in my article without resorting to misogyny but apparently not for some people ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:46:47+00:00,lets have more than one lauras idea is great we need many many more women represented in our public space as well as in our public life and from all political viewpoints ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:43:17+00:00,im sure you do genuinely believe indy is the best option while i genuinely passionately reject it for all the reasons of plus i think itd be additional chaos layered on top of brexit chaos we can agree to disagree on that but at least agree on ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:41:03+00:00,where we disagree i will also speak out say so and i dont think the sg record is nearly good enough comparing anything to the current shambles of a uk govt isnt really a fair benchmark its way too low a bar ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:39:14+00:00,im working closely with stephen gethins on brexit shared a stage with the fabulous hannah bardell at the march women yesterday agreed lots with kirsty blackman on a panel today often give credit to nicola sturgeon for her feminist record ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:22:10+00:00,im basing my comment on what people told me on the doorsteps about ns scotgovt as i said people also spoke to me about their voting intentions which was backed up by the election result so i have confidence these conversations were fairly representative of ed at least ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:13:34+00:00,i suspect we will rhiannon vehement is one thing and totally fair enough though i think we would both agree theres never any excuse for misogynistic attacks whatever people want to say can be said and more powerfully without references to witches necrophilia and so on ,joswinson
2018-03-05 22:07:00+00:00,hillary clinton brings out anger hatred in people trump rallies with chants of lock her up and so on diane abbott received of hateful abuse directed at mps at ge point is there is a lot of hatred of women in society esp those with power ,joswinson

2018-03-05 21:57:45+00:00,thanks for reading it not everyone bothered im not saying she was a feminist but that she was significant as i said devastatingly successful in advancing her ideology one i deeply oppose unintentionally she challenged stereotypes of women as weak unable to lead ,joswinson

2018-03-05 21:39:36+00:00,thanks for your thoughtful thread helen we agree on much why did i mention thatcher there was a specific q on this when i did question time from grantham her birthplace i was asked to expand on it in an article which i broadened to wider need for more women in public space,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:52:49+00:00,the more presidential nature of politics tv debates which are a good development make this inevitable i think ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:50:09+00:00,hi josh heres what i wrote appreciate you wont agree but thought you should at least see my actual argument ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:47:22+00:00,im not saying they are the same but what they do have in common is they are seen as much more divisive figures than men espousing the same views the fierce vitriol they receive is partly due to their stances but also definitely gendered ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:21:30+00:00,i was talking about my experience knocking on doors in east dunb gillian youre right chris election result doesnt directly show views of ns but it does lend weight to what i reported was said to me ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:16:44+00:00,did you see that superb no more boys girls miniseries on bbc last year eye opening esp the bit where adults played with toddlers whod had their clothes gender swapped ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:14:42+00:00,good on you obv i disagree with your cause but in general the more people prepared to volunteer to go knock on doors for political parties the more engaging and healthy a democracy well have ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:09:13+00:00,or here ,joswinson
2018-03-05 20:00:22+00:00,thanks for your past support james i imagine ns is popular among indy supporters but then indy itself isnt very popular in ed indyref result no across the council area even higher in the constituency ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:57:08+00:00,to be fair it was rather confirmed by the election result ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:55:44+00:00,i know it is hard for snp supporters to believe but that is indeed the reality in ed rather backed up by the election result where there was a big swing from snp to lib dem ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:37:25+00:00,not having double standards for men and women in this is important and i dont think were there yet ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:35:52+00:00,the intro to my book makes the point that we are all sexist women as well as men have internalised the stereotypes ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:34:28+00:00,i didnt say it was unanimous but there was quite a strength of feeling noticeably different to ge  and reflected in the result ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:31:18+00:00,well i personally knocked on thousands obv not everyone in ,joswinson
2018-03-05 19:24:55+00:00,quite also the one role in childrens books where female characters outnumber male parents dads are largely missing bravo mister seahorse ,joswinson
2018-03-05 16:28:41+00:00,ruaraidh if the whole country agreed what bad things were many things would be easier we dont all agree so either we recognise no one who was divisive not a test applied to statues of men or we dont imply a statue agreement by all ,joswinson
2018-03-05 16:10:56+00:00,theres some fascinating research on gender in childrens books that i quote in equal power even animals male animals outnumber female animals ,joswinson

2018-03-05 15:26:34+00:00,cheers chris from my experience doorknocking in east dunb at the ge ns was certainly very unpopular and im a big believer in taking action having just written a whole book about how individuals can take action to promote gender equality ,joswinson
2018-03-05 15:20:25+00:00,i was asked on qt in grantham birthplace of thatcher what i thought of the idea waa asked to expand my views in an article which i did extending issue to women in public space generally my whole point is we need many more women statues including those we disagree with ,joswinson
2018-03-05 15:12:48+00:00,fair enough to disagree rhiannon but do if you havent read the piece i think we need to recognise women across political spectrum the treatment hatred directed at some women in politics e g thatcher sturgeon clinton is gendered goes beyond anger at their policies ,joswinson
2018-03-05 15:04:41+00:00,actually daily mail refused to publish it as i criticise thatcher it was mail on sunday did you read the article to see my argument ,joswinson
2018-03-05 15:03:08+00:00,great message human kindness often undervalued ,joswinson
2018-03-05 14:58:55+00:00,read the piece david my message is gender equality hardly reactionary and i suggest it is a message that needs to be heard and internalised more by mos readership compared to say the guardian ,joswinson
2018-03-05 14:55:47+00:00,i know nicola sturgeon isnt very popular with my constituents most dont rate her record in govt but as you know that didnt stop me saying that as first woman fm there should also in time be a statue of sturgeon ,joswinson
2018-03-05 14:51:39+00:00,great idea just the kind of thing existing benchmarks should incorporate ,joswinson
2018-03-05 14:49:37+00:00,thats also the risk of writing on gender equality at all as i explain in the intro to my book cant just stay silent as an alternative ,joswinson
2018-03-05 14:46:02+00:00,its not either or i want to see lots more statues of women ,joswinson
2018-03-04 23:52:30+00:00,what an amazing energy at today ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:33:33+00:00,im advocating precisely for many more statues of all kinds of women but not only ones i agree with ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:32:03+00:00,im also pretty certain most of my constituents wouldnt want a statue of nicola sturgeon either which as you know i called for in the same piece my point is we should recognise significance even when we disagree with the politics ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:28:41+00:00,glad to have sparked debate and good suggestions on more statues of women most comments have been lively and engaging with varied views on the thatcher issue but some have made my point for me about the gendered vitriol of public debate misogynist tropes must stop ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:18:35+00:00,not in a public space there is one in an area of parliament that is usually only open to mps and certain staff ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:16:52+00:00,i never said she was a feminist with respect i think mos readers are probably more in need of reading articles about gender equality than guardian ones ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:14:58+00:00,no not with most people though i have met some on the doorsteps who liked her ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:06:31+00:00,as i said in my article i do think being the first woman pm esp in backdrop of s tory sexism was hugely significant im not arguing for her above all else we need many many more women including controversial ones ,joswinson
2018-03-04 22:01:38+00:00,also calling for statue of sturgeon do you think that suddenly makes me pro indy ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:58:46+00:00,fair enough good show though always makes me cry when i watch when pregnant ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:57:09+00:00,a good suggestion certainly my whole point is we need many women in our public space in this way including significant women who divided opinion ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:52:26+00:00,parliament square was the suggestion ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:50:59+00:00,well women are behind the men there at the moment thatll be down to next month when the fawcett statue is unveiled so plenty more needed ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:48:58+00:00,and the snp one too by your logic or maybe i think we shouldnt only have statues of those we agree with ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:47:18+00:00,this is explicitly not about political ideology the whole point is recognising significance without agreeing as you know i also call for a statue of sturgeon in this hardly very right wing ,joswinson
2018-03-04 21:44:31+00:00,certainly agree with florence n suggestion ,joswinson
2018-03-04 20:44:02+00:00,leanne i never said i agreed with her or liked her politics my point is women are hugely lacking in public space as in public life and statues should not only be of those we agree with my full piece is here ,joswinson
2018-03-04 20:40:04+00:00,actually i think the readership there is a pretty good target for arguments about importance of gender equality and more women in public space not like they get that in the rest of the paper ,joswinson
2018-03-04 20:34:19+00:00,my point is we need lots not just one more and our first woman pm should be among those ,joswinson
2018-03-04 20:30:46+00:00,im advocating many more statues of women those i agree with and celebrate as well as those like thatcher who i hugely disagreed with but were nonetheless significant id encourage you to read my piece not just the social media commentary on it ,joswinson
2018-03-04 15:15:22+00:00,not saying it doesnt matter but im saying the test we apply to statues of men is significance not whether we like what they did thats why in the same article i argue that there should in time be a statue of nicola sturgeon too ,joswinson
2018-03-04 15:12:57+00:00,there should be a statue in public space such as parliament square currently has statues all men members lobby in parliament is only accessible to mps and a small group of staff for most of the time ,joswinson
2018-03-04 14:15:44+00:00,yes i do my argument isnt based on agreement with what she did in fact despite asking me to write it following question time the daily mail refused to publish it as i am critical of thatcher read the piece ,joswinson
2018-03-04 14:12:24+00:00,maybe if you read the piece you will understand my argument about more women in public space ,joswinson
2018-03-04 14:11:00+00:00,read my piece russ im no fan of thatcher our public space tells a story about significant people in our history if we require women to pass a non controversy test unlike men we will never achieve equality ,joswinson
2018-03-04 14:08:01+00:00,thanks wendy ,joswinson
2018-03-04 14:07:38+00:00,in fact the daily mail who originally asked for the article following up on my question time comments refused to publish it because it was too critical of thatcher so the mail on sunday published instead ,joswinson
2018-03-04 14:05:24+00:00,heres what i wrote ,joswinson
2018-03-04 13:52:51+00:00,frankly i dont think describing politicians even those we vigorously disagree with as pure evil does anything to advance our democratic debate ,joswinson
2018-03-04 13:49:45+00:00,id be interested to hear your view after you dont have to agree with me of course ,joswinson
2018-03-04 11:34:04+00:00,more statues of women generallym including those we vigorously disagree with read my argument here ,joswinson
2018-03-04 11:28:02+00:00,and also a statue of a first minister i vigorously disagree with read the piece its about stopping the erasure of women from our public space ,joswinson
2018-03-04 11:26:23+00:00,no its mail on sunday today not daily mail though i appreciate online its the same though online audience a bit different anyway ,joswinson
2018-03-04 11:23:55+00:00,the suggestion was parliament square though in the same article i did suggest a statue of nicola sturgeon which would make sense to be close to the scottish parliament ,joswinson
2018-03-04 11:19:43+00:00,in the same article i called for a statue of nicola sturgeon do you think that makes me a nationalist ,joswinson
2018-03-04 11:16:38+00:00,and after i was ever so even handed calling for a statue of in the same article too ,joswinson
2018-03-04 10:01:14+00:00,sure in a tweet creating a world with more gender equality is a better one to leave for the next generation if you want more ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:57:22+00:00,and now mail on sunday readers will hopefully take on board that point intriguingly the daily mail originally asked me to write the piece after i was on qt and that q came up but they refused to print it as i was too critical of thatcher ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:54:42+00:00,i am more sceptical about the possibility of eroding visual impact by rational thought my work on body image shows its not that easy to disassociate ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:40:24+00:00,i suppose we just differ on whether the act of being pm was helpful i agree she didnt try to help women but think she did unintentionally by breaking stereotypes e g that women were weak indecisive unsuited to the responsibility ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:38:16+00:00,yeah though its hardly likely the world has had loads even in  most countries have never had one ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:37:16+00:00,fair viewpoint but do you agree with my main point that we should have many more statues of women ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:35:10+00:00,yes but then my objection remains the visual wallpaper stays mainly male even if historic this has an impact today ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:33:58+00:00,thanks steven and most importantly for your commitment to your vital nhs its amazing what lengths you your colleagues have gone to in these awful conditions ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:31:52+00:00,did you read the piece my point is exactly that we should have lots more statues of women including our first woman pm ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:30:33+00:00,thats why i said almost exclusively ,joswinson
2018-03-04 09:01:49+00:00,well for one thing unless we start taking some down if we just stop here then the public realm wallpaper of statues is almost exclusively male ,joswinson
2018-03-03 23:57:30+00:00,looking forward to for our daughters and sons we have much to do to create a world of ,joswinson
2018-03-03 23:00:34+00:00,hope you enjoy it rick ,joswinson

2018-03-02 14:40:51+00:00,glad you enjoyed it more thoughts here ,joswinson
2018-03-02 14:39:21+00:00,stefan says men weighted to higher end of pay at ca richard you said gap may be due to family friendly practices my q would be why would these positions mean less pay per hr less women in top quartile lack of senior part time roles is part of pay gap and worth changing ,joswinson
2018-03-02 14:26:21+00:00,may especially our young people who are the seeds of our success in the future thatll be the same young people who voted overwhelmingly to remain then ,joswinson
2018-03-02 14:22:11+00:00,may is right to recognise vital role of eu agencies and importance of shared regulation all this talk of reciprocal agreements deep and comprehensive partnerships just makes the point for keeping the partnership we have the best one being members of the eu ,joswinson
2018-02-27 23:07:47+00:00,thanks claire will do,joswinson

2018-02-25 20:17:42+00:00,a perfect example of why we need a better immigration policy this is a shockingly ridiculous decision ,joswinson
2018-02-25 17:09:44+00:00,good point ,joswinson
2018-02-25 16:58:10+00:00,dont know i think the violence chapter might be one to avoid as it is a tough read and work might not feel very relevant but imagine childhood sport and culture might appeal but you know her best have a look and see what you think ,joswinson
2018-02-25 16:54:39+00:00,sure but its much easier to consider all types of diversity in the design phase if your team isnt homogenous and prone to groupthink ,joswinson
2018-02-25 16:52:22+00:00,hope she enjoys it ,joswinson
2018-02-25 15:24:45+00:00,i led a debate on this in parliament last month and govt is setting up a centre for data ethics i will keep on the case ,joswinson
2018-02-25 13:48:01+00:00,simply fascinating and pretty terrifying long read by on the influence of youtube algorithms h t ,joswinson
2018-02-25 00:22:46+00:00,one of many reasons why diversity in tech matters as we use more artificial intelligence we risk embedding and reinforcing bias and discrimination instead of ending it ,joswinson
2018-02-24 23:56:24+00:00,so good to finally see un agreement on syria ceasefire need to use it to bring practical assistance and hope to those desperate people who have been living through hell ,joswinson
2018-02-24 14:41:56+00:00,thats a very kind thing to say ian ,joswinson
2018-02-24 08:35:15+00:00,was gove not just saying that the eu might prevent us from ditching plastic straws can the brexiteers make their minds up on which ridiculous attack they want to try ,joswinson
2018-02-23 19:20:16+00:00,i thought it was you i saw going in to the nexr door cabin last night sleeper train a lovely way to travel ,joswinson
2018-02-23 09:45:26+00:00,have you looked at the benefits of dads doing so this shouldnt be about either gender bearing all the responsibility and sharing that more will also help reduce discrimination ,joswinson
2018-02-23 09:41:14+00:00,thats exactly where i was at yrs ago this blog of my speeches esp the nd explains more not that it cant in theory be done that way more a realism of whether it will be enough after yrs of working to make that happen ,joswinson
2018-02-23 07:48:21+00:00,its far from my only idea so id certainly be interested to see what you make of the rest ,joswinson
2018-02-23 00:04:08+00:00,thanks tamsyn and very good point on ivf ,joswinson

2018-02-22 23:59:54+00:00,delighted youve ordered my book it has literally dozens of suggestions for how we do it and it is not an exhaustive list first thing is to recognise we do not live in a gender neutral world when it comes to opportunity ,joswinson
2018-02-22 19:31:54+00:00, loving that youre taking action before youve even finished the book ,joswinson
2018-02-22 19:29:41+00:00,obviously id much prefer equality of opportunity and have literally written the book on how we can create it ,joswinson
2018-02-22 19:25:30+00:00, things you can do email your mp link to research ask them for action from govt to tackle this donate to fund essential helpline for women facing discrimination talk to friends amp family to challenge these attitudes ,joswinson

2018-02-18 15:18:08+00:00,yes i agree it needs to be good quality education and obv age appropriate too ,joswinson
2018-02-18 15:16:05+00:00,men can be feminists too you know ,joswinson
2018-02-18 13:20:40+00:00,if recent scandals tell us anything its that importance of consent is poorly understood by some govt decision to drop plans for compulsory relationships sex education is a massive backwards step ,joswinson
2018-02-18 13:10:39+00:00,excellent nuanced piece from on the oxfam crisis,joswinson
2018-02-18 00:12:30+00:00,me ,joswinson
2018-02-18 00:05:22+00:00,sending love the nastiness youre receiving on here is unwarranted and unrepresentative of the wider world too ,joswinson
2018-02-17 14:52:10+00:00,it would certainly be interesting to see the justification for such a ban ,joswinson
2018-02-17 14:46:43+00:00,superb skeleton ing pregnancy olympics tears ,joswinson
2018-02-17 11:28:55+00:00, happy birthday ,joswinson
2018-02-17 11:19:56+00:00,enjoy it ,joswinson
2018-02-17 11:14:04+00:00,i appreciate we have different understandings of feminism i dont believe it is in one direction at all my book also deals with areas where gender inequality disadvantages men and i still see fighting that as feminism ,joswinson
2018-02-17 11:11:04+00:00,that example is also in my book ,joswinson
2018-02-17 11:09:31+00:00,i think this might be my favourite pic of to date ,joswinson
2018-02-17 11:03:48+00:00,good on you becca well done ,joswinson
2018-02-16 18:21:41+00:00,not russian taxpayers though mate ,joswinson
2018-02-16 18:20:35+00:00,i appreciate what the impact is for an individual however lets keep it in perspective false allegations are no more common for sexual violence than any other crime under reporting is a much bigger problem ,joswinson
2018-02-16 18:13:33+00:00,your views are noted though many other members have expressed support for my stance promoting equality is a key part of liberalism its not about me its about the kind of society we want to create as lib dems gender equality is fundamental to that ,joswinson
2018-02-15 22:07:32+00:00,really interesting analysis gerry thanks ,joswinson
2018-02-15 20:49:11+00:00,discussed that at some length on question time a fortnight ago,joswinson
2018-02-15 20:46:06+00:00,for the record i didnt mention the book on the radio i was asked to go on to discuss parris comments would you rather id declined the today interview ,joswinson
2018-02-15 20:42:56+00:00,obv dont know full details letter conflates equal pay with gender pay gap but theyre different things however even if evidence shows women bame go for promotion less response from employer should be to find ways to give support to change that not accept as immutable ,joswinson
2018-02-15 20:31:31+00:00,also really enjoyed it ,joswinson
2018-02-15 19:24:25+00:00,brilliant research in this thread but a sad indicator of societys constant default to whiteness as he says even in fantasy worlds ,joswinson
2018-02-15 18:19:18+00:00,i tried to focus more on what individuals can do rather than govt but it is a good point ,joswinson
2018-02-15 16:39:30+00:00,interesting article i dont agree with all of its policy prescriptions and i guess you wouldnt either but the general point about the important role fathers play is a crucial one and overlooked in our analysis along with the common pattern for prior violence against women ,joswinson
2018-02-15 15:41:22+00:00,no that most definitely doesnt help,joswinson
2018-02-15 09:55:02+00:00,fair enough it was better if youd heard the interview,joswinson
2018-02-15 09:50:30+00:00,if you dont like my tweets feel free to unfollow ,joswinson
2018-02-15 09:17:27+00:00,if only id listened to matthew parris and realised women are winning i could have saved myself a lot of time writing then again maybe not ,joswinson
2018-02-14 12:19:58+00:00,in a civilised society we can disagree and debate and importantly do so without hate sending to political opponents who are also fabulous feminist sisters such as working to create a world of ,joswinson
2018-02-14 12:09:13+00:00,not the first time ive irritated conservatives both small and big c ,joswinson
2018-02-14 07:44:35+00:00,fascinating on use of girls to describe women sexist or endearing unpicks the context that makes all the difference h t ,joswinson
2018-02-14 07:24:18+00:00,congratulations cuppa with me you to chat pregnancy amp parliament perhaps x,joswinson
2018-02-14 07:15:28+00:00,it certainly seems to jar with the valentines day spirit ,joswinson
2018-02-14 07:13:21+00:00,if you like the ideas for action in that youll love my book which is full of them ,joswinson
2018-02-13 23:55:15+00:00,i do love the deadpan way you say thats why we called it our future our choice or ofoc for short ,joswinson
2018-02-13 23:48:34+00:00,their word but i would argue it is far too common across the board my point was precisely that its problematic to single out oxfam for these stats rather than recognising workplace sexual harassment as an endemic under reported problem ,joswinson
2018-02-13 22:45:58+00:00,i call out my own party and work for change there too ,joswinson
2018-02-13 22:43:28+00:00,and my right to express my opinion of it ,joswinson
2018-02-13 08:32:29+00:00,im not absolving them of anything i hope this will lead to more reflection and change about what employers can do differently ,joswinson
2018-02-13 08:30:23+00:00,thats why oxfam absolutely has questions to answer as i said in my tweet ,joswinson
2018-02-13 08:28:48+00:00,well the overall numbers are pretty high ,joswinson
2018-02-13 08:27:18+00:00,rife in all workplaces mate thats my point and the link to the evidence was in my tweet ,joswinson
2018-02-13 08:23:59+00:00,its called free speech ,joswinson
2018-02-13 08:22:54+00:00,an absence of sexual harassment should not be the highest standard it should be a basic part of dignity in any workplace it is no more acceptable in a general retailer than in a charity shop the mails agenda is not about tackling harassment though ,joswinson
2018-02-13 07:56:40+00:00,did i say ignored i meant dismissed this is how the mail covered that research on sexual harassment,joswinson
2018-02-13 07:52:52+00:00,fixed your headline for you clearly oxfam has questions to answer however sexual harassment abuse of power is far too common right across all workplaces thats the wider issue conveniently ignored by some ,joswinson
2018-02-12 23:38:48+00:00,superb short piece on tech gig economy amp employment rights by ,joswinson
2018-02-12 23:33:17+00:00,why dont they just go the whole hog give them legs each and paint them black arobophobia ,joswinson
2018-02-12 23:27:50+00:00,the story rather suggests it would indeed be negotiable with cabinet office as matt hancock clearly managed years ago before spl even existed ,joswinson
2018-02-12 23:25:33+00:00,intrigued by this answer though didnt hear interview matt hancock took months paternity leave though so even if there are technical yes minister barriers to spl its not impossible for men to take more time ,joswinson
2018-02-12 23:21:17+00:00,with spl employer policy can impact on pay but not eligibility thats a separate legal right though not all couples eligible yet ,joswinson
2018-02-12 20:33:11+00:00,im already in touch with the fabulous on this ,joswinson
2018-02-12 20:30:00+00:00,fascinating stuff both on encouraging switching and depressingly its limitations ,joswinson
2018-02-12 20:19:14+00:00,absolutely something that should be addressed in this years review as was always the intention ,joswinson
2018-02-12 20:18:34+00:00,theres a clear unsurprising pattern those employers that enhance sppay in the same way as maternity pay see a much greater spl uptake so i agree encouraging more to do this is a crucial part of the campaign ,joswinson

2018-02-04 14:13:18+00:00,thanks it was nearly yrs ago i stopped him im fine but this isnt about me and thats the danger in media reporting of it i mention the incident in my book to show how run of the mill such experiences are the change thats needed ,joswinson

2018-02-03 11:39:50+00:00,its the main story in our latest kirky focus happy to take up points on yr behalf too niall pls remind me yr address etc by email jo swinson mp uk as prev mp records obv deleted most important thing is listening to community views genuine consultation this time ,joswinson
2018-02-03 00:17:15+00:00,i didnt mention views on marriage on abortion very few countries deny women who are raped access to abortion indeed many catholic countries permit it i do not believe this is a mainstream position in the uk it is literally at an extreme end of public opinion ,joswinson
2018-02-02 23:59:34+00:00,i agree the views expressed by john mcdonnell endorsing and encouraging this kind of behaviour are abhorrent we must defend political discourse as a place for civilised disagreement and robust debate not violence ,joswinson
2018-02-02 23:52:40+00:00,appalled by scenes from bristol today i strongly disagree with on many issues but the way to challenge is by engaging in debate precisely what he was there to do deeply worrying to see violent tactics by political opponents ,joswinson
2018-02-02 23:32:40+00:00,i said i think his views are extreme he has the right to hold express and debate those views and i respect his right to do so there is no excuse for violence and no place for it in our politics ,joswinson
2018-02-02 23:23:51+00:00,there is a way to avoid this fate ,joswinson
2018-02-02 19:06:38+00:00,i didnt say this was an exhaustive list ,joswinson
2018-02-02 18:52:39+00:00,pretty much sums up the attitude of those defending rees moggs approach to parenting its sad because we know involved fatherhood from the start is good for children evidence here ,joswinson
2018-02-02 18:47:35+00:00,this is genuine debate about how free sanitary products can best be accessed our cllrs listened to pupils msyps your cllrs disagreed fine but there is not as your snp msp claimed any disagreement on providing free period products in schools that was an outright lie ,joswinson
2018-02-02 17:01:56+00:00,i knew you just needed reminding ,joswinson
2018-02-02 16:58:47+00:00,quite unless you know that is the title they use themselves ,joswinson
2018-02-02 16:46:31+00:00, ms sturgeon stephen shes not years old ,joswinson
2018-02-02 15:58:50+00:00,no thats called having an opinion and expressing it ,joswinson
2018-02-02 15:57:29+00:00,a good wow ,joswinson
2018-02-02 14:07:02+00:00,he is allowed to hold his views and i am allowed to criticise them and consider them to be extreme ,joswinson
2018-02-02 13:41:46+00:00,except that is blatantly not true paul please check your facts better fact lib dems voted to continue free provision of sanitary products in aberdeenshire schools as you can see below the wording from the council papers they voted for ,joswinson
2018-02-02 10:48:19+00:00,i was challenged on why i thought he was extreme i explained and hes the one who put his nappy changing views into the public domain ,joswinson
2018-02-02 10:40:59+00:00,no one is suggesting parents should change every nappy but i remain of the view that never changing a single one of the thousands of nappies your children have needed and boasting about it is extreme ,joswinson
2018-02-02 10:37:00+00:00, children never changing one nappy lets be clear what that means literally never spending quality time alone with your baby babies need nappy changes often being liberal doesnt mean thinking its ok for people to choose to ignore their responsibilities as a parent ,joswinson
2018-02-02 10:29:20+00:00,involved fatherhood is good for children i wont apologise for promoting it or criticising those who undermine it ,joswinson
2018-02-02 10:27:58+00:00,we had a bit of an inputs outputs division of labour i did more of the feeding did more of the ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:48:40+00:00,i would be equally scathing about any woman with children who made a similar boast totally agree different people choose to split parenting differently but not one nappy for kids and boasting is outrageous essentially saying caring for babies not part of a dads role ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:42:49+00:00,quite there is a long list ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:41:31+00:00,this is addressed to those enraged by it as well as engaged ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:39:34+00:00,lib dems are in nd place in vauxhall join us and make a lib dem mp for vauxhall happen ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:37:46+00:00,well spotted i meant enraged ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:36:16+00:00,there are certainly some fabulous people there like the audience member who reminded everyone about the shocking number of women killed by their partner former partner every week ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:34:11+00:00,attitudes like his are an insult to the vast majority of men who take fatherhood seriously and love their role as dads ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:29:25+00:00,you think its sexist to say that when people have a child or both parents have a responsibility to change nappies sometimes i mean in the first months alone for children were talking around nappies not changing one ever takes some active avoidance ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:20:29+00:00,dont worry about me i knew in advance doing qt in a place that voted leave that my brexit answers might not get the warmest welcome in the studio audience ,joswinson
2018-02-02 08:07:38+00:00,thats a bit harsh pretty sure tims tweet was sent tongue in cheek right after we had a chat about how i and other women panellists usually get tweets criticising clothes jewellery appearance ,joswinson
2018-02-02 07:58:22+00:00,to those engaged by me calling jacob rees mogg extreme on it is extreme to deny even women who have been raped access to safe abortion have children and think its acceptable to boast about never having changed a nappy ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:56:57+00:00,the merida tip on seam splitting was excellent ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:31:58+00:00,you always had a way with words hope youre well fond memories of the team ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:23:09+00:00,yes who would have thought a feminist would back a statue of the first woman pm ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:12:20+00:00,only a bit before its not edited unless someone swears and i restrained myself tonight ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:11:07+00:00,and if youd like to meet and campaign for change with more people with our views ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:09:37+00:00,i clearly didnt say enough ,joswinson
2018-02-02 00:03:40+00:00,as would confirm i would never win a prize for domestic science good at making toast though ,joswinson
2018-02-01 23:55:37+00:00,thanks though we were already filming by the time you sent this ,joswinson
2018-02-01 23:53:00+00:00,the point is not that davids are bad just a balance issue ,joswinson

2018-02-01 22:13:04+00:00,well that was fun ,joswinson

2018-02-01 10:53:11+00:00,shouldve gone to hive ,joswinson
2018-02-01 09:55:16+00:00,in the green room looking forward to discussing with at am,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:55:23+00:00,links if youre interested and,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:53:39+00:00,there are also gender inequalities and assumptions that disadvantage men these exist and are important as i have spoken about in parliament and my tedx talk on importance of dads just less voluminous than gender injustices against women ,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:49:11+00:00,its late and i have a long day tomorrow so cant do a long chat but misogyny sexism that disadvantages women are so structurally embedded through culture gender related detriment is an everyday experience for women it is common so ingrained it can be unintentional ,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:24:06+00:00,because of the structural nature of gender inequality in our society plus that has been north yorks experience ,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:18:42+00:00,theyre not the only ones ,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:08:27+00:00,to be honest youre the first person ive ever come across called tailed,joswinson
2018-01-31 22:06:05+00:00,as i said in the interview i think we should be open to misandry being included as north yorks police have agreed even though numbers would be expected to be far fewer,joswinson
2018-01-31 21:02:46+00:00,odd point to make re this panel last week snp were on this week im on so scotland hardly being kept out of debate ,joswinson
2018-01-31 18:25:29+00:00,always up for some cross party solidarity on important issues and feminism needs to be beyond party lines to make progress as i know april agrees ,joswinson
2018-01-31 13:12:15+00:00,agree not good recruitment tactic do people often assume youre called debbie ,joswinson
2018-01-31 13:09:39+00:00,well it counts as a good reason in my book ,joswinson
2018-01-31 12:28:51+00:00, mag photoshoots can be fun but just as well that isnt the standard for leaflets ,joswinson
2018-01-31 12:22:34+00:00,cheers zara ,joswinson
2018-01-31 12:21:57+00:00,because even if we closed every nuclear power station tomorrow we would still need the nuclear scientists engineers for decades to come to deal with safe decommissioning ,joswinson
2018-01-31 12:19:05+00:00,delighted to hear it phil ,joswinson
2018-01-31 12:14:16+00:00,thanks fiona ,joswinson

2018-01-30 21:41:01+00:00,its been happening for years its not ai to blame just assumptions that mp journalist person in authority man the default is male ,joswinson
2018-01-30 21:38:34+00:00,never too early and lots in there about early months of childhood ,joswinson
2018-01-30 19:08:17+00:00,even had similar experience as a government minister ,joswinson
2018-01-30 19:04:22+00:00,yes its called sexism structurally ingrained in society,joswinson
2018-01-30 19:02:12+00:00,i still get things addressed to mr swinson ,joswinson
2018-01-30 18:54:10+00:00,hmm i think i know my constituents a little better than you do not least that anglo saxon is not how most people in the west of scotland would describe their ideals ,joswinson
2018-01-30 18:38:37+00:00,youll love the stuff on gender pay gap reporting ,joswinson
2018-01-30 12:52:14+00:00,link didnt post properly also it should be humphrys ,joswinson
2018-01-30 12:42:17+00:00,shocking bbc women being punished for raising important questions about equal pay audiences being denied this debate men who have expressed views on the issue evan davis john humphries continue unhindered same old gender power dynamics pauy uk a e b d de e,joswinson

2018-01-29 23:52:34+00:00,this earlier tweet relevant here too ,joswinson
2018-01-29 21:09:58+00:00,well try to create that in lords obv in commons arithmetic means need to convince some on govt side too or at very least some strategic abstentions from them ,joswinson
2018-01-29 21:08:10+00:00,exactly important campaign ,joswinson
2018-01-29 19:32:53+00:00,a current cabinet minister urgh ,joswinson

2018-01-29 16:51:34+00:00, may be better placed to answer im not entirely sure how that works ,joswinson
2018-01-29 16:49:20+00:00,thanks for the plug ian ,joswinson
2018-01-29 14:18:48+00:00,i agree it is not a perfect world but rather than sit back and accept it i choose to try to make it better i have a life thanks and will continue to stick to my liberal principles and by the way its ms swinson not miss ,joswinson
2018-01-29 14:13:00+00:00,thanks jim ,joswinson
2018-01-29 12:35:22+00:00,except thats crap harassment has real impact it creates fear and intimidation women dont know if it will stop at words or lead to worse we can feel the need to change our routes home or to work sometimes our clothes just to feel safe thats a restriction of our freedom ,joswinson
2018-01-29 12:31:19+00:00,do share what the reaction was ,joswinson
2018-01-29 12:30:04+00:00,and you miss the point making misogyny a hate crime does not make anything not currently a crime a crime it just makes them easier to deal with and encourages reporting ,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:49:38+00:00,good point i agree the raising wider awareness of the condition and potential fatal consequences is important ,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:45:33+00:00, of women first experience street harassment as teenagers it is absolutely not being dealt with currently,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:39:42+00:00,think the context is pretty clearly the rude meaning ,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:38:08+00:00,that really is astonishing youd think there would be some soul searching and advice on best practice for protecting event staff etc ,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:36:06+00:00,not a word id usually use on daytime tv but ,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:31:06+00:00,its not about making anything a crime that isnt currently its about recognising the additional fear caused by targeting people for being a woman gay black disabled etc,joswinson
2018-01-29 11:28:04+00:00,and that behaviour is also not ok i agree ,joswinson
2018-01-29 01:27:53+00:00,growing support for the people to have the final say on the brexit deal sign the petition if you agree ,joswinson

2018-01-27 11:02:34+00:00,i appreciate the more entrenched societal divisions are a problem but still ,joswinson
2018-01-27 09:43:17+00:00,well thats a deal breaker then ,joswinson
2018-01-27 09:37:51+00:00,answer no,joswinson

2018-01-27 08:41:16+00:00,you are making my original point for me the letter dismisses the issue of powerful men groping women which is the story here not something i introduced as silly and not seriously newsworthy prevalence of that attitude is what shows how far we have to go on gender equality ,joswinson
2018-01-27 08:35:05+00:00, exposing abuse of power is not red top journalism the reader could express their disappointment without benn dismissive and condescending silly young girls to the women who were groped in their workplace ,joswinson
2018-01-27 08:15:04+00:00,you know you must be right when you open twitter and the people disagreeing with you are motorbikewanker and arron banks ,joswinson
2018-01-27 08:08:54+00:00,did you ever attend a presidents club dinner ,joswinson
2018-01-27 08:02:37+00:00,i think the tweet youre looking for mr wanker is this,joswinson
2018-01-27 01:04:33+00:00,i didnt say the letter condoned groping you said it was equally obnoxious to both i explained how thats not true journalist looked because tipped off then gathered evidence testimony contracts etc thorough high ft stdrds why doubt this not their ftse analysis say ,joswinson
2018-01-27 00:20:50+00:00,yes the airlines whose practices currently put lives at risk we were accompanied by amys story shows just how devastating nut allergy can be ,joswinson
2018-01-27 00:16:47+00:00,very impressed you got the mail to actually use your correct title ms for once instead of their ridiculous style guide obsession with calling all women miss or mrs ,joswinson
2018-01-27 00:10:38+00:00,not equally obnoxious at all men groping women deserve condemnation worse than sillier women being groped do not it was not their fault they are not silly using men and young girls is very unequal all were adults this is outstanding journalism from ft ,joswinson
2018-01-26 23:49:54+00:00,this is what were up against im glad the is printing these letters to demonstrate how far society incl ft readership has to go on gender equality ,joswinson
2018-01-26 20:43:29+00:00,brilliant stuff launches presidents club rival event via h t ,joswinson
2018-01-26 12:46:43+00:00,just going to leave this excerpt from the sexual offences act here ,joswinson
2018-01-26 11:01:35+00:00,love the way he feels the need to use the adjective attractive and indeed the subtext that women out of somehow brought on all this behaviour with their dastardly feminine wiles,joswinson
2018-01-26 10:57:54+00:00,indeed as i say with busy diaries and people in meetings it is not possible to contact everyone and for everyone to see messages at such short notice ,joswinson
2018-01-26 10:55:33+00:00,again pls dont interpret lack of signature as lack of support coordinating lots of signatures for an urgent letter in just a few hours has its challenges ,joswinson
2018-01-26 08:43:18+00:00,it is entirely possible to fundraise for and donate to charity without groping women end of ,joswinson
2018-01-26 00:30:45+00:00,well theres a caption competion waiting to happen ,joswinson
2018-01-25 22:09:37+00:00,great to meet you and bond over hillarys advice on resilience ,joswinson
2018-01-25 22:05:50+00:00,plus while we may disagree on lots of things i suspect we both think dan is wrong to call the presidents club shenanigans a non story ,joswinson
2018-01-25 22:02:01+00:00,sounds an amazing idea ,joswinson
2018-01-25 21:52:11+00:00,as ive said before please dont read missing names as necessarily meaning lack of support coordinating signatures at short notice is a challenge and can never be comprehensive ,joswinson
2018-01-25 15:57:47+00:00,again pls dont read lack of names as lack of support coordinating signatures at short notice is tricky i imagine vicky kerri will both have been appalled too ,joswinson
2018-01-25 15:39:31+00:00,can you be specific about your concerns the biggest part of the expenses is the cost of the staff in my office who provide an invaluable service for my constituents assisting them with all kinds of problems ,joswinson
2018-01-25 11:36:39+00:00,thank you to aviation minister baroness sugg for a constructive meeting yesterday on how to make air travel safer for people with nut allergy im confident we can make progress ,joswinson
2018-01-25 10:58:42+00:00,astonished that the prime minister thought the objectification of women was only in the past ,joswinson
2018-01-25 07:17:52+00:00,words fail me ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:49:52+00:00,yeah i always think it says a lot about someone when they call men men but women are females ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:46:52+00:00,rent bills power dynamics in many contexts workers are afraid to change unfair behaviour by employers it doesnt make it right it is no excuse for the behaviour of the organisers and attendees ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:42:50+00:00,reassured to see a swift and robust response from the charity commission and look forward to arranging a meeting to discuss further ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:22:41+00:00,perhaps organisers of other events may be a little more thoughtful after this ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:18:13+00:00,genuinely very glad to see dfe act quickly to sack david meller from their board i have no doubt he was asked to resign and very robust on this in response to a great question from we stand together we can create change ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:12:58+00:00,its partly just the logistics of coordinating signatures at short notice i have more women mps numbers to text many men very supportive too ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:11:39+00:00,a very wise comment ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:06:29+00:00,pls dont read into names not being on here as necessarily meaning lack of support its hard to coordinate names at short notice for an urgent letter im pretty confident both gareth and nick would be appalled by the behaviour ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:04:05+00:00,not refused its just hard to get to everyone in a timely way before sending an urgent letter ,joswinson
2018-01-24 22:02:50+00:00,completely agree collecting signatures at short notice isnt an exact science and i now know of others since the letter was sent who are very supportive ,joswinson
2018-01-24 21:59:52+00:00,to be fair gathering signatures at short notice partly depends on whose numbers you have to text plus lab women mps group kindly circulated cheers ,joswinson
2018-01-24 21:55:25+00:00,i am in regular somewhat frustrating correspondence with scotrail on their service problems of late do feel free to drop me a line at jo swinson mp uk and i can add your concerns to the list ,joswinson
2018-01-24 21:48:30+00:00,thanks for your support margot and apologies i hadnt seen this in time but glad you wanted to so good to see voices like yours in govt speaking out on this ,joswinson
2018-01-24 20:16:18+00:00,of course hence my use of the word parts ,joswinson
2018-01-24 20:15:36+00:00,how did have any vested interest respected journalist from respected publication hardly known for having a go at business she was reporting what she found ,joswinson
2018-01-24 17:59:14+00:00,thank you to the mps from all parties who have supported my complaint and charity commission referral of the presidents club charitable trust following the revelations ,joswinson
2018-01-24 14:31:25+00:00,some rich and powerful men think that lecherous pawing and groping of women is acceptable it simply has to stop ,joswinson
2018-01-23 22:36:08+00:00,youd have thought so certainly should be ,joswinson
2018-01-23 22:32:51+00:00,do you mean a comment other than condemning it and agreeing to have a discussion with him about it as he asked ,joswinson
2018-01-23 22:27:49+00:00,more than rich businessmen were perfectly happy to attend such an event which shows what a rotten sexist culture is still alive and kicking in parts of the business community time s up on this crap ,joswinson
2018-01-23 22:26:22+00:00,simply stomach churning sinister directions dictating what underwear women should wear blurb suggesting cosmetic surgery would add spice to your wife business demanding a woman rip off her knickers multiple reports of sexual assault ,joswinson
2018-01-23 22:21:44+00:00,superb but deeply disturbing report by kudos to for lifting the lid on this rotten culture that still exists in some parts of business community ,joswinson
2018-01-22 22:56:57+00:00,i agree with will yrs old lego designer would be such a cool job deeper messages here too from the research about how to open childrens horizons ,joswinson
2018-01-22 22:51:37+00:00,jason i utterly condemn the actions you have described here and im glad the police are involved more than happy to arrange a discussion too just contact my office who can set it up jo swinson mp uk,joswinson
2018-01-22 22:45:13+00:00,i appreciate we have a difference of opinion here jackie i stand by my concerns regardless of our differences do let me know if i can ever help you as a constituent with a specific case ,joswinson
2018-01-21 11:46:11+00:00,happy to see you at any of my surgeries ,joswinson
2018-01-20 19:55:13+00:00,you asked me to reply to mhairis question which i did ,joswinson
2018-01-20 19:30:39+00:00,i spend lots of my time campaigning against brexit including working closely and constructively with stephen gethins on this ,joswinson
2018-01-20 16:06:18+00:00,i think the ppb was commissioned to deliver snp messages and i also think the mocked characters resemblance in name and looks to david torrance was deliberate as it seems a pretty unlikely coincidence ,joswinson
2018-01-20 16:03:49+00:00,there are much more appropriate ways for politicians to challenge or correct slanted or biased opinion pieces which happen every day on all sides than using a ppb to mock ,joswinson
2018-01-20 16:00:25+00:00,so fair game this is ultimately about power power of govt is partly held in check by media sometimes unfairly annoyingly uncomfortably the power of individual commentators like dt is dwarfed by power of govt which is why leaders should be careful of using theirs to mock ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:51:57+00:00,no but i certainly found the images of independent journalists having to make their way through a crowd of protesters to go to work very uncomfortable and that is the wider context here and why snp leadership should be more careful about what messages they are sending ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:44:04+00:00,freedom of the press does not mean the freedom to commit criminal offences like hacking into peoples phones ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:41:54+00:00,im not for a second suggesting all coverage of politicians is fair ive called out misogynistic coverage of nicola sturgeon other women politicians in past and will continue to do so but yes the press must be free to criticise and satirise governments scrutiny is vital ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:35:01+00:00,the first minister should have more important things to be doing than mocking journalists especially when snp activists have crowded round bbc hq to call for sacking of and complained about shortly before he was mysteriously silenced ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:24:52+00:00,those two objectives are not mutually exclusive as i say it could easily have been done with a character that didnt look like and have the same name as a critical journalist ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:21:58+00:00,i seriously agree esp as part of a worrying trend including the large crowd outside pacific quay calling for to be sacked for doing his job and what happened to ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:18:15+00:00,it could be complete coincidence that the ppb character davey looks very like the journalist david torrance who often criticises govt or not ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:15:50+00:00,tenuous here is the ppb character called davey and the journalist david torrance ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:11:56+00:00,seriously i dont understand why they chose to cast that role in that way if not to mock a specific journalist and that they dont think that is problematic and beneath the office of first minister esp in context of crowd outside pacific quay firing of etc ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:07:56+00:00,im not saying its perfect just not improved by govt undermining reputable outlets and journalists just because they disagree ,joswinson
2018-01-20 15:05:36+00:00,nonsense you could have done the exact same broadcast without the mocked character cast to look like and named after a journalist often critical of govt policy youre in government not student politics ,joswinson
2018-01-20 14:44:19+00:00,important thread on the democratic dangers of any government undermining freedom of the press ,joswinson
2018-01-20 14:23:08+00:00,join us and help campaign to have a referendum on the final deal and to win it ,joswinson
2018-01-20 09:32:11+00:00,arguing against a policy because some media outlets are lazy or ill informed is a non starter ,joswinson
2018-01-20 09:31:26+00:00,seriously the media misrepresent me and others constantly when discussing equality issues why should it be a reason not to have useful data just because in this case employers might be misrepresented ,joswinson
2018-01-20 09:22:15+00:00,it gives us info to ask questions the employer narrative should be the part detailing what each individual org should do deviations from are not automatically a problem esp if overall in diff companies those roughly balance out that is not the case however ,joswinson
2018-01-19 23:56:22+00:00,forget boris bikes its boris blokes ,joswinson
2018-01-19 23:41:29+00:00,not sure that needs to be the way its done is a sustainable model ,joswinson
2018-01-19 23:37:33+00:00,being able to change your mind is a pretty fundamental freedom and im proposing a vote on the final deal which is clearly democratic ,joswinson
2018-01-19 22:47:56+00:00,i think it should be improved e g penalties for non compliance requiring narratives etc and we should encourage informed analysis of the data as we should with all data the existence of misinterpretation by some does not mean the idea is at fault ,joswinson
2018-01-19 08:10:32+00:00,why do you say that because we disagree on something ,joswinson
2018-01-18 23:40:59+00:00,tricky although on average you could say im in manchester with it being halfway between glasgow london ,joswinson
2018-01-18 23:37:37+00:00,no i read all the applications myself last westminster role i advertised had apply without this requirement which i recognise means some wont bother applying i dont see how it would have been manageable to read them all ,joswinson
2018-01-18 20:17:33+00:00,thats pretty standard for a minute debate usual format is mins by mp leading it and mins by minister having other mps contribute actually made this relatively busy for a short adjournment debate ,joswinson
2018-01-18 20:11:07+00:00,im not sure how to make the labour party see sense in so many ways nor can a good chunk of their mps its very simple really all women shortlists trans women are women so obviously should be eligible ,joswinson
2018-01-18 19:26:50+00:00,you can read the whole thing here ,joswinson
2018-01-18 07:05:12+00:00,it is absolutely possible,joswinson
2018-01-18 07:04:07+00:00,people have the right to change their mind its a pretty fundamental freedom,joswinson
2018-01-17 23:16:54+00:00,great stuff we should have a cuppa soon and discuss ideas re your new role x,joswinson
2018-01-17 23:11:58+00:00,fancy working in westminster to stop brexit protect liberal values im looking for someone bright politically astute who makes things happen to join my team ,joswinson

2018-01-16 23:26:42+00:00,happy to let you know outcomes of my enquires if you drop me an email to jo swinson mp uk twitter is great for many things but not very handy for tracking constituency casework ,joswinson

2018-01-16 23:21:35+00:00,agree this is clearly their general protocol which is problematic for many and could potentially be changed just not realistically by tomorrow ,joswinson
2018-01-16 22:13:27+00:00,appreciate this wont help you for tomorrow mind ,joswinson

2018-01-15 21:16:56+00:00,legislating to change marketing is tricky though are looking at guidance on changing gender stereotyping in ads another option could be exploring extending equality duties to private sector as they are flexible ,joswinson

2018-01-09 08:25:48+00:00,boris johnson cant be bothered to read his brief about uk citizens wrongly imprisoned abroad keeps his job david davis misled mps over existence of brexit impact analysis keeps his job justine greening sacked double standards reshuffle ,joswinson
2018-01-08 21:47:41+00:00, congratulations to you amp millie ,joswinson
2018-01-08 09:24:10+00:00,woohoo ,joswinson
2018-01-08 09:22:55+00:00,we all love a feminist horse except the conservative woman blog ,joswinson
2018-01-08 08:21:40+00:00,bravo for making a powerful stand on has serious questions to answer for workers at all levels in the organisation ,joswinson
2018-01-07 13:39:22+00:00,have your lunch im just back from a run about to embark on some work planning post xmas toy organising ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:45:53+00:00,thats interesting first draft of regs was to include numbers but they changed that think gov uk website ought to require this info ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:44:32+00:00,to a point yes really doesnt seem like a bad story to me while never room for complacency ill certainly feel no shame continuing to wear my necklaces ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:42:27+00:00,i know questioning why was my initial tweet sometimes parts of the media commentariat will be unfair or uninformed just look at all the crap write ups of spl takeup its not a reason not to publish info that helps us understand problems can be a catalyst for change ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:39:19+00:00,am i missing something surely we can determine that from the figures  people per quartile and we know split so can be pretty confident within rounding errors ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:36:10+00:00,this is the relevant graphic and i think its up to them to give more analysis of this also cant easily find link to their board or exec team to see that split if id written the actual regs id have made a narrative explanation a requirement ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:29:41+00:00,not everyone needs to want promotion but we shouldn t assume men want it more not every firm needs a gap but overall we need to get to a place where the gaps in different companies existing for various reasons roughly cancel each other out thats far from where we are ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:26:18+00:00,ive been criticised for high staff costs in  when staff were on maternity leave does that mean we shouldnt have transparency of mps office costs of course not ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:24:08+00:00,we get a good idea of the pyramid shape from the salary quartile data should we not have transparency because some people will misinterpret the data no ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:19:46+00:00,as with most gpg figures this highlights discrepancies between senior and junior levels in terms of gender obeying equal pay law is not sufficient its bizarre that many womens fashion companies are so dominated by men at senior levels ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:15:38+00:00,a company with such a high proportion of women staff should absolutely be asking why they dont manage to replicate that at senior levels and what things they could do to ensure women can progress ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:14:22+00:00,they dont have to be exactly the same but where you have men progressing up the pyramid more than women in an org i dont think we should just accept it as a fact of life that senior roles will obv have more men than junior roles ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:10:31+00:00,if it exhibits the familiar pyramid structure where women disproportionately fall away compared to men as you get to more senior levels granted this one is far from the worst example but where that pattern exists it should be questioned analysed understood and addressed ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:04:39+00:00,yes thats true and the qs i raised re promotions very pertinent plus their action plan very vague but would similar errors be tolerated in annual accounts and does it signify the priority level put on this data ,joswinson
2018-01-07 12:02:19+00:00,i dont understand what boycott calls are based on but ob still have bias towards greater of men at senior levels  compared to junior  id like to see their action plan to address that and less complacency that as they arent breaking equal pay law its all ok ,joswinson
2018-01-07 11:55:51+00:00,wholeheartedly agree thats why i introduced shared parental leave and did a whole tedx talk on this ,joswinson
2018-01-07 11:49:44+00:00,sure they gave male employees and women of the men are in presumably higher paid roles at head office glad theyve rectified their numerical error but given these stats have to be signed off by a senior director before publication the error not impressive ,joswinson
2018-01-07 11:26:06+00:00,that would be incredibly helpful thank you i think swinsonj possibly get through but it is now jo swinson mp uk,joswinson
2018-01-07 11:24:42+00:00,the figure is shocking largely driven by employees being men but senior leadership they boast of internal promotions being women but this is poor when women are of staff and basic numeracy fail  female employees but overall ,joswinson
2018-01-07 11:15:14+00:00,transparency driving customer questions is the point of gpg reporting that i won the battle for in govt but my reading of stats suggest theyre not the worst  mean amp  median still work to do obv but not comparable to mean gpg of ,joswinson
2018-01-07 09:08:30+00:00,but did you accurately name the in between ,joswinson
2018-01-06 10:44:31+00:00,this is brilliant ,joswinson
2018-01-06 10:43:40+00:00,you absolutely deserve to be in vogue ,joswinson

2017-12-24 11:35:59+00:00,absolutely jane by raising the cost of speaking out for those who have experienced harassment those fuelling these media attacks are reinforcing a culture where powerful people can harass others with impunity ,joswinson
2017-12-22 15:35:14+00:00,fancy some festive cheer watch this ,joswinson
2017-12-21 17:16:50+00:00,obv i didnt have long on each paper and like the others the he one had no impact assessments sector concerns listed included staff student mobility plus future participation in horizon  erasmus ,joswinson
2017-12-21 12:19:27+00:00,at least you can decide for yourself now though the most interesting bit is the bit thats not published ,joswinson
2017-12-21 12:05:35+00:00,addendum thanks to the committee you can now read the reports online minus the section on sector views  ,joswinson
2017-12-21 10:26:04+00:00,only mps and peers,joswinson
2017-12-21 09:25:09+00:00,to be clear i think you should delete or reword that tweet ,joswinson
2017-12-21 09:20:39+00:00,we should be careful not to ape the language of violence even when we feel strongly ,joswinson
2017-12-21 09:13:40+00:00,yes you have to book slots i can and may book another ,joswinson
2017-12-21 09:07:27+00:00,from my necessarily brief notes they were concerned about tariffs non tariff barriers and customs and skills ,joswinson
2017-12-21 08:54:30+00:00,its certainly very oh no he didnt ,joswinson
2017-12-21 08:52:33+00:00,many mps are indeed going to look though when many of these papers are individually upwards of pages there is no real substitute for govt just publishing online,joswinson
2017-12-21 08:32:10+00:00,also you can book more than one slot so i may go back for the other ,joswinson
2017-12-21 08:30:30+00:00,phones are confiscated and two officials stay in the room while i was there someones phone went off buried deep in her bag the look on the officials face was priceless as soon as she turned it off he was over her shoulder asking politely for it ,joswinson
2017-12-21 07:36:49+00:00,just in the hour i was there i saw other mps there lab tory snp and lib dem peer ,joswinson
2017-12-21 07:31:02+00:00,lots of mp peers are going to look at them no doubt some are focusing on specific sector papers i was interested in getting more of an overview ,joswinson
2017-12-21 07:28:54+00:00,a damn good question ,joswinson
2017-12-21 07:28:05+00:00,to be clear thats industry support not government position ,joswinson
2017-12-21 07:27:08+00:00,ah yes i should have tagged in that tweet about what should mps with visual impairments do rather than the spoof account ,joswinson
2017-12-21 07:25:45+00:00,well no sign of them actually having internalised the stuff about you know impact ,joswinson
2017-12-20 23:10:01+00:00,this last point especially gaby is so spot on the way those who speak out are treated is toxic ,joswinson
2017-12-20 21:29:57+00:00,horrific ,joswinson
2017-12-20 21:20:01+00:00,i did started with a got as far as n nuclear ,joswinson
2017-12-20 21:18:58+00:00,true errors is a charitable description ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:33:34+00:00,an hour i can and may book another slot ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:33:03+00:00,good question not sure maybe will tell us ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:32:35+00:00,it was printed probably on a dot matrix though ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:31:45+00:00,some are collated e g various different sectors captured within creative industries paper,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:25:59+00:00,bottom line even from my hour perusing the governments collation of brexit views across sectors it was blindingly obvious what a far reaching ridiculous folly this whole brexit debacle is ends ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:22:00+00:00,or that the government has withheld the key impact analysis from what it has released to parliament which goes against the house of commons motion of nov i almost hope it is the latter as that would mean the government has actually done some impact analysis ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:18:28+00:00,this raises the prospect either that the production of these papers and conspicuous secrecy around their content is nothing more than a costly vanity exercise to cover up davis errors in telling the select committee the analysis existed in excruciating detail  ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:14:37+00:00,but that rather conflicts with what david davis has been saying for months  ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:12:32+00:00,of course the government now claim they never did any sectoral impact assessments only sectoral analysis ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:09:15+00:00,this is how the contents are described for example the agriculture one had pages of background facts and pages of sector views most worryingly no analysis at all of what the impact of brexit could be ,joswinson
2017-12-20 20:02:54+00:00,frustratingly only mps peers can see these papers and armed with pen and paper only i transcribed the parts i have recreated here yet given the caveat below printed on every document there is no reason for them not to be freely available online ,joswinson
2017-12-20 19:58:21+00:00,the government has also been lobbied by many sectors for eu regulations to be kept or mirrored exactly or face significant negative consequences ,joswinson
2017-12-20 19:53:22+00:00,the papers detail calls from many sectors to remain part of existing eu institutions programmes or agreements such as easa euratom iem horizon  erasmus and ses ,joswinson
2017-12-20 19:45:41+00:00,of these sectors the papers show that in of them industry has concerns about skills gaps attracting talent and labour mobility post brexit ,joswinson
2017-12-20 19:42:00+00:00,today i viewed the sectoral analysis in the brexit reading room i was handed two hefty lever arch files during my slot i managed to look at of the separate papers ,joswinson
2017-12-20 19:13:47+00:00,thats a shame but no doubt your future will be exciting let me know if you fancy a coffee catch up in the new year ,joswinson
2017-12-20 19:06:33+00:00,whereas id be more than satisfied with the former ,joswinson
2017-12-19 22:44:23+00:00, id love to meet up to pick your brains on cyber regulation ethics and data up for a cuppa ,joswinson
2017-12-19 00:03:13+00:00,of course and thank you ,joswinson
2017-12-18 17:43:21+00:00,this looks like a shabby deal govt complicit in covering up source of dups huge brexit donation against transparency laws required for political funding in rest of uk ,joswinson
2017-12-18 17:28:29+00:00,congratulations good luck in your new role and keep at it on this topic ,joswinson
2017-12-18 14:29:30+00:00,that doesnt sound good at all happy to take up the case with the authorities if you drop me an email jo swinson mp uk,joswinson
2017-12-18 12:30:12+00:00,thanks nicola i entirely understand and have contacted the council this morning ,joswinson

2017-12-16 09:56:21+00:00,i hadnt seen it but interesting stuff the likeability penalty for successful women is certainly a problem ,joswinson
2017-12-16 09:52:55+00:00,no but i agree its a lovely useful word ,joswinson
2017-12-14 21:01:33+00:00,fascinating important evidence here essential viewing for anyone chairing a panel q a h t ,joswinson
2017-12-14 20:57:31+00:00,nope entirely disagree families are partnerships and theres no innate reason why men better at providing or women better at childcare ,joswinson
2017-12-14 20:53:02+00:00,everyone is damned by the mail ,joswinson
2017-12-14 20:52:29+00:00,very much so that the mail wants to set up a catfight between women with different working patterns is frustrating theres too much guilt about all kinds of parenting choices we do not all need to do it the same way ,joswinson
2017-12-14 19:43:13+00:00,i completely agree double standards around parenting is one of the ways gender inequality hurts men ,joswinson
2017-12-14 19:40:43+00:00,and that needs to change ,joswinson
2017-12-13 23:00:56+00:00,dear ,joswinson

2017-12-13 18:47:27+00:00,kudos to those who will defy their whip tonight to put country before party lots of strong speeches in todays debate hoping cross party working tonight will defeat the govt on plans to bypass parliament in brexit process ,joswinson

2017-12-12 10:00:01+00:00,think thats unfair criticism its an annual event the success of which doesnt rely on whether the pm happens to have kids or not ,joswinson

2017-12-10 13:04:45+00:00,it has been a long time in the making almost years by the time its published ,joswinson
2017-12-10 13:03:34+00:00,not sure it is and theres obv separate argument about unpaid work but still think important to have the info considered by gender to encourage better policy making ,joswinson

2017-12-08 09:49:28+00:00,i agree from personal experience the combination of evidence that breastfeeding is beneficial plus little practical support to make it work is a recipe for frustration feelings of failure and lower bf rates,joswinson

2017-11-02 08:21:39+00:00,we have jeanne who is outwith the standard party hierarchies i really do encourage you to report what happened ,joswinson

2017-11-01 21:44:50+00:00,not convinced this does split me from public opinion but even if so i will defend activists right to be treated professionally by mps ,joswinson
2017-11-01 21:39:59+00:00,did you read her piece yes it was in context of whether she might run for parliament and need backing ,joswinson
2017-11-01 21:37:59+00:00,hes a very senior mp and she says the behaviour was in the context of him offering to help with her career ,joswinson
2017-11-01 19:45:55+00:00,but a boss flirting with you unwanted touching thats unprofessional it puts the junior member of staff in a difficult position ,joswinson
2017-11-01 19:44:21+00:00,sometimes may not be a problem between two people with equal power in a social situation for example so in those cases not on spectrum ,joswinson
2017-11-01 19:42:15+00:00,my point is there are different severeties of harassment from light grey to dark if you like but its all a problem ,joswinson

2017-09-11 07:31:58+00:00,you were absolutely right to ask that question ,joswinson
2017-09-11 07:17:47+00:00,absolutely will be challenging govt on this ,joswinson

2017-09-09 10:58:39+00:00,im not so sure that doesnt actually tackle the problem ,joswinson
2017-09-09 08:24:51+00:00,thats very defeatist i disagree that we should just accept behaviour online that people would never do offline ,joswinson
2017-09-09 08:23:12+00:00,agree a fascinating read and must be part of the debate ,joswinson
2017-09-09 07:29:56+00:00,this really underlines the importance of bringing more compassion and love into the online world how do we do it ,joswinson

2017-09-08 22:06:56+00:00,your move ,joswinson
2017-09-08 08:42:01+00:00, largely due to my race gender doesnt mean i cant have an opinion but i do have duty to listen consider from others perspectives ,joswinson
2017-09-08 08:39:45+00:00,i can take part in a debate on police stop search but i recognise my privilege on this ive never been stopped searched ,joswinson
2017-09-08 08:37:18+00:00,knowing what it is is different from a personal understanding of that fear thats one reason we need diversity in hoc many perspectives ,joswinson
2017-09-08 08:35:00+00:00,great post practicality is really key ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:49:48+00:00,anyone who has never feared being raped i imagine they are mostly men as most women have known this fear as have some men of course ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:47:10+00:00,im delighted youre in that fortunate position many dont have the luxury of that choice it isnt their fault ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:44:39+00:00,only if you think wealth is only kind of privilege i was referring to privilege of not fearing rape some men have this almost no women ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:42:14+00:00,not referring to that kind of privilege ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:41:39+00:00,that is precisely what i mean but didnt label it male privilege as so have some men worried about this ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:40:01+00:00,why if youve never feared being raped that is a privilege not enjoyed by well over half the population count yourself lucky empathise ,joswinson
2017-09-07 22:37:42+00:00,have you really never felt afraid of this walking home at night ,joswinson
2017-09-07 08:16:30+00:00,if you want to create a society where your loved ones have less fear of rape support orgs like who do great work ,joswinson
2017-09-07 08:15:27+00:00,male privilege largely for some men only others have feared rape but i dont know any women who have that privilege ,joswinson
2017-09-07 06:08:02+00:00,well we clearly have a disagreement on this but thanks for sharing your views ,joswinson
2017-09-06 19:42:22+00:00,but i profoundly disagree with forcing rape victims or any woman to go through with pregnancy against their will ,joswinson
2017-09-06 19:40:54+00:00,science doesnt agree on any single simple answer to that question so you can hardly expect me to do so in characters ,joswinson
2017-09-06 19:21:58+00:00,which is why i didnt specify male privilege some men do know this fear and almost all women ,joswinson
2017-09-06 19:20:42+00:00,no of course not but neither is forced pregnancy we have clear laws in place to regulate time limits ,joswinson
2017-09-06 17:00:25+00:00,precisely because many men who are rape survivors too or have feared it but of course not all men wouldnt that make a good hashtag ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:58:49+00:00,which i deliberately didnt want to call male privilege because i recognise it is only a subset of men who have it and unrelated to ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:57:40+00:00,privilege is not just about socio economic status for example i have privilege just because of the colour of my skin among other things ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:55:54+00:00,exactly so not all men have the privilege of not knowing that fear but almost no women have it ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:52:10+00:00,i did consider lucky but we all have different privilege we should recognise which is why i used it to me means much more than class ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:38:40+00:00,or being a survivor of sexual violence they have considered the issue from a deeper and different perspective ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:37:49+00:00,and for all those who have experienced gripping their keys being followed home at night or a narrow escape with someone they know ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:31:48+00:00,but the tenor of his speech suggested little empathy or sign that he had ever thought hard about how someone in those shoes might feel ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:29:25+00:00,i absolutely recognise that not suggesting men cant be raped or fear rape and i dont know for sure whether jrm has feared it ever ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:26:25+00:00,but that doesnt mean it was about class have all men feared rape i think most if not all women have at some point ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:24:33+00:00,nope i was referring to privilege of not having had that fear partly as a result of gender though not just some men have had this fear,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:18:47+00:00,not to mention the entire pregnancy ,joswinson
2017-09-06 16:16:52+00:00,quite that was exactly my meaning,joswinson
2017-09-06 13:35:07+00:00,and for the record i was not referring to his privilege of wealth,joswinson
2017-09-06 09:31:13+00:00,opposing abortion even for rape survivors may be easier for those privileged enough never to have feared being raped ,joswinson
2017-09-06 05:44:59+00:00,i have my disagreements with diane but also disagree with you on this elizabeth her story is inspiring ,joswinson
2017-09-06 05:43:04+00:00,incredibly disproportionate and the nature of it is on a different level,joswinson
2017-09-05 12:02:43+00:00,sobering stats on online abuse of women mps bme women get more than white appalling levels hurled damages democracy ,joswinson
2017-09-05 10:06:19+00:00,quite its terrifying enough if youre next to a hospital ,joswinson
2017-09-05 10:05:18+00:00,it can be a really worrying condition hope your nephew is doing well ,joswinson
2017-09-05 08:45:18+00:00,well the two i turfed out onto the street are miles apart thankfully ,joswinson

2017-07-27 21:26:29+00:00,quite problematic by a man in a position to encourage business leaders not to see it as an issue about women just needing to ask for more,joswinson
2017-07-27 21:24:35+00:00,i dont think resigning would have stopped them and dont know what more i could have done short of that ,joswinson

2017-07-26 22:38:08+00:00,it was hugely frustrating not to make progress on this battle but i did on many others which is what made me hope ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:37:04+00:00,actually all of those things not poss in opposition degree of access for ministerial meetings cabinet departmental review ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:35:23+00:00,if its a coalition and you never support any policy you disagree with then how can any coalition ever work hugh ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:32:19+00:00,evidence mounted policy bad tories refused review we pressed repeatedly even did bis review moj refused to countenance any change ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:28:43+00:00,fighting many battles felt could do more in govt than out won battles for workers min wage enforcement flex work unpaid et awards fines,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:23:41+00:00,voting record represents cr article summarises actions pressed moj ministers at meetings raised at cabinet even bis did our own review ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:20:39+00:00,they just did ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:20:12+00:00,have you read the article ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:19:14+00:00,i was answering a q about vexatious claims which is why i used word never supportive of fees but did abide by collective responsibility ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:16:22+00:00,really disappointing ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:14:36+00:00,that et rules will recognise moj changes on fees is not surprising ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:13:32+00:00,except that release isnt about introducing fees which moj did this was about improving rules processes changes generally welcomed ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:11:42+00:00,no change of heart saying publicly now what i argued privately then sadly not one of the battles i won in govt,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:08:52+00:00,bound by collective responsibility then but argued strongly against won many other battles e g fire at will ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:05:53+00:00,yes i was in that govt and i consistently argued against this in govt sadly not one of the battles i won ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:04:00+00:00,nope just now able to say publicly what i argued privately then ,joswinson
2017-07-26 22:00:16+00:00,i did in public abided by collective responsibility still support efforts to resolve disputes without tribunal if poss better all round ,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:54:52+00:00,the scars on my back from coalition fights like this many others which i won say otherwise ,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:52:50+00:00,i fought these fees in govt gutted i didnt win this battle but did many others e g penalties for et unpaid awards,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:49:25+00:00,cheers lizzy ,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:48:13+00:00,thanks simone ,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:44:51+00:00, govt decision made before i was minister et fees moj not bis remit i fought internally but had collective responsibility,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:39:42+00:00,all about et rules and processes widely welcomed changes not about fees ,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:38:27+00:00,the press notice was introducing early conciliation dispute resolution by acas not fees ,joswinson
2017-07-26 21:37:09+00:00,no i didnt rebel on other issues when i was in government by definition of course most tribunal claims are not vexatious ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:46:47+00:00,for clarity i did not introduce these fees they were ministry of justice and i fought against them within govt ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:44:07+00:00,hardly all of a sudden eunis i was raising it pretty constantly within govt ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:43:24+00:00,this was one of my most frustrating battles in govt and i wish i had been able to kill tribunal fees delighted supreme court has done so ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:41:53+00:00,no vince was never lord chancellor it was ministry of justice otherwise we could have done the review acted on it,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:40:29+00:00,perfectly aware of course what was not so public then was how i fought this within the coalition ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:38:35+00:00,not that silent ive just been on radio ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:37:16+00:00,i fought them ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:36:31+00:00,thats how collective responsibility works,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:35:46+00:00,actually not when govt decided to do this  but when i was a minister i did sadly unsuccessfully fight this ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:34:32+00:00,yes i was in govt fighting this sadly not one of the battles i won ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:32:50+00:00,nope consistent with what i argued within govt at the time ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:32:26+00:00,collective responsibility are you familiar with it fought against this in govt sadly not one of the battles i won,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:31:24+00:00,oh and,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:29:07+00:00,i fought them in govt ministry of justice would not budge ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:27:59+00:00,im no longer bound by collective responsibility so cab say publicly what i argued privately then ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:26:28+00:00,i tried to kill it and wish id succeeded ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:25:37+00:00,yes thats true did i agree with it no fought it in govt and delighted supreme court has killed it ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:24:32+00:00,no i disagreed with the policy tried to kill it in govt and am delighted the supreme court has done so ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:23:38+00:00,lots of internal battles i wish we had won this is one of them ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:22:57+00:00,tried my best to get rid of them wish i had succeeded ,joswinson
2017-07-26 16:22:23+00:00,and fought them within govt i didnt win every battle ,joswinson
2017-07-26 08:43:03+00:00,thats why ive spent the last two days interviewing and looking over office plan layouts have some staff in place but not full team yet ,joswinson
2017-07-25 21:11:59+00:00,no problem i cant reply to everything or id never get anything done but i do like to read and engage when i can ,joswinson
2017-07-25 20:38:48+00:00,ive just spent weeks on doorsteps hearing local people tell me how they feel about this believe me people are emotionally invested in uk ,joswinson
2017-07-25 17:00:56+00:00,yes i suppose it did get rather more likes than usual ,joswinson
2017-07-25 16:59:11+00:00,its been weeks needed to advertise give people time to apply and then interview suspect that is quicker than many ,joswinson
2017-07-25 08:23:28+00:00, th day of interviews for new staff today im getting team in place but apologise response times not yet what i want ,joswinson
2017-07-25 08:21:57+00:00,actually lib dems didnt let this happen during coalition it was only with tory majority that referendum called ,joswinson
2017-07-24 20:31:50+00:00,i think back in gpew backed indy but delighted if they change their view on that,joswinson
2017-07-24 20:31:10+00:00,thanks steven ,joswinson
2017-07-24 20:09:05+00:00,thank you for your congrats true they could have abstained but fact remains they had pivotal votes in that division ,joswinson

2017-07-24 19:48:30+00:00,in a whole white paper of detail on indy was rejected we still dont know brexit detail people should have final say on the deal,joswinson
2017-07-24 19:45:28+00:00,so if theyd voted differently it would have been  in the other direction counting ,joswinson
2017-07-24 10:39:34+00:00,sure ,joswinson
2017-07-23 20:29:19+00:00,i agree there are cases that require a difficult balance but also that with sensitivity it is possible,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:52:09+00:00,fair enough figured it might be the case after that tweet but hopefully explaibs strong feelings on this fwiw i think caroline is amazing,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:46:50+00:00,seriously without green support snp would have lost indyref vote ,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:42:21+00:00,sounds like you think independent or not is no big deal believe me to millions here it is both uk eu bits of my tweet were important ,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:38:12+00:00,not in favour of the uk part of my tweet sadly patrick harvie co trying hard to break it up ,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:37:03+00:00,hang on thanks to the greens propping up the snp were being threatened with it whenever it suits nicola sturgeon not a long way off ,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:34:37+00:00,for the united kingdom within those delighted to hear the stance on indy has changed since  is this a recent change ,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:31:07+00:00,read my tweet support for uk in sm and uk in eu ,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:28:53+00:00,that has been received wisdom but many dont feel that way and i believe in respecting the individual,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:26:53+00:00,sadly for millions of people brexit is being used by snp scotgreens to cast doubt on them getting to stay in uk,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:25:04+00:00,im glad there are some in other parties who see sense on eu and will work with them for best outcome,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:23:41+00:00, uk in the eu even if you support its certainly not uk wide green position given determination of scottish greens to break up uk,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:21:59+00:00,its not the first time ive certainly said it before but yes lib dems are the home for those who want to fight to keep us in eu,joswinson
2017-07-23 18:19:09+00:00,snp plaid greens in scotland at least caroline lucas may not agree all support breaking up uk so do not share ld position,joswinson
2017-07-23 09:43:20+00:00,its blindingly obvious only one party is committed to uk membership of the single market and indeed uk staying in the eu ,joswinson

2017-07-06 19:31:18+00:00,maybe but its the judging of what is controversial some things might seem uncontroversial but not be when looked at politically ,joswinson
2017-07-06 18:57:09+00:00,of course i do and will ,joswinson
2017-07-06 18:55:18+00:00,were all free to speak and to disagree with each other ,joswinson
2017-07-06 18:52:47+00:00,having said that any june meeting is news to me ,joswinson
2017-07-06 18:51:45+00:00,was told it would only proceed by unanimity only addressing uncontroversial changes therefore figured better on it with veto than not ,joswinson
2017-07-06 18:50:25+00:00,i did raise the issue of non bme representation and poor gender balance recommended names for inclusion sadly not acted on ,joswinson
2017-07-06 17:36:59+00:00,with about half as many votes thought the snp used to agree first past the post was a rubbish system ,joswinson
2017-07-06 16:46:00+00:00,shocking failures by authorities response to domestic violence still woefully inadequate preventable murder ,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:43:32+00:00,how have i overruled it ive criticised it and said they should think again ,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:42:16+00:00,i do think scotland london n ireland and indeed the whole of the uk should have that say thats literally my policy ,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:40:37+00:00,like when i was on question time with stephen gethins you mean so were bbc promoting him responsible for his vote victory seriously ,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:38:35+00:00,happy to engage but my thinking on what on why snp msps voting for indyref hasnt made me change my mind on it ,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:36:24+00:00,paul i get to say what i think as do you and im making the case that many in east dunb wanted made by their mp over last yrs ,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:33:02+00:00,i was elected wks ago to put this very case you can hardly question the mandate i have from east dunb to do so even though you disagree,joswinson
2017-07-06 14:28:25+00:00,lots of people oppose indyref lib dems labour tories and many former snp voters i met during election,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:46:02+00:00,i will be doing surgeries in baldernock church hall in balmore as well like before but people welcome from anywhere at any venue ,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:43:58+00:00,i dont live on twitter you know but thanks for the chat,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:41:56+00:00,fair enough if you want indy tbh the snp is the more obvious party for you i disagree with you on indy though we may share other views ,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:39:52+00:00,arguable there were various reasons for the result i think anyway im sitting opposite the tories in hoc now so whats your point ,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:36:20+00:00,i knew a proportional representation voting analogy would be the best way to explain it to fellow lib dems ,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:33:58+00:00,debatable i think its most but you dont ,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:32:46+00:00,no,joswinson
2017-07-06 11:31:52+00:00,youre right i do think that ,joswinson
2017-07-06 10:50:12+00:00,dont be so sure ,joswinson
2017-07-06 10:02:52+00:00,refusing to engage in brexit debate is like only voting st pref in stv election if you dont get preferred outcome no say on final result,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:58:40+00:00,then i look forward to the snp backing a referendum on whether the uk should accept the brexit deal or stay in eu,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:55:19+00:00,no im representing the interests of the people who elected me and gave me a crystal clear mandate to do all i can to stop indyref ,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:54:04+00:00,when we see the detail of the deal people not politicians should have the final say and the right to reject it,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:52:26+00:00,i dont see how the position outlined in my tweet deviates from promoting the collective good ,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:47:42+00:00,not scared in any way im doing my job my constituents and much of scotland dont want indyref ,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:45:13+00:00,memo they just voted me in and did so precisely to oppose indyref ,joswinson
2017-07-06 09:40:29+00:00,youre right the media will always find a stick to beat us with,joswinson
2017-07-05 22:41:54+00:00,totally agree there is huge amount of ageism,joswinson
2017-07-05 22:34:49+00:00,true  chars so i wrapped up a lot in other entrenched bias ,joswinson

2017-07-05 11:30:04+00:00,intend to send out posters to lots of local places advertising them as before but getting staff office in place is prerequisite for that ,joswinson
2017-07-05 11:24:02+00:00,thats one of the places i looked at re office space a couple of weeks ago,joswinson
2017-07-05 11:23:09+00:00,ive had surgeries already booking next tranche now currently negotiating a lease for constituency office ,joswinson

2017-07-04 23:10:34+00:00,agree though not mutually exclusive with using our influence in hoc to put cross party pressure on the govt to change its brexit positions,joswinson
2017-07-04 08:57:48+00:00,not going to happen though is it ,joswinson
2017-07-02 21:00:08+00:00,i hope so but i think we need to work at it not just assume it will happen automatically ,joswinson
2017-07-02 20:39:00+00:00,its a bit more complicated than one opinion poll though if polls consistently move in that direction it is helpful ,joswinson
2017-07-02 18:35:01+00:00,to different degrees ,joswinson
2017-07-02 18:34:21+00:00,i havent seen ridge today i was doing sunday politics scotland i do know journos often twist words into sensationalist headlines ,joswinson
2017-07-02 18:29:24+00:00,thanks katie ,joswinson

2017-07-01 21:36:23+00:00,worth noting the authors of articles dont write the headlines ,joswinson
2017-07-01 14:00:13+00:00,gloomy indeed means crafting an alternative is pressing ,joswinson
2017-07-01 13:34:38+00:00,im not happy about that and i will do what i can to stop it but surely makes no sense to pretend otherwise and miss chance to influence ,joswinson
2017-07-01 13:33:39+00:00,im not defeated its just my political judgment is given con lab back brexit have mps that it is more likely to happen than not ,joswinson
2017-07-01 13:31:30+00:00,did you live through it last time the impact on scottish political debate since doesnt suggest any less division ,joswinson
2017-07-01 13:30:09+00:00,the strength of feeling on culture economics history and family ties is such that ge in scotland was all about indy not brexit ,joswinson
2017-07-01 13:28:48+00:00,i understand your sentiment but take how you feel about brexit and multiply by thats how many scots like me feel about indy ,joswinson
2017-07-01 13:25:52+00:00,in scotland only fptp vote is now ge lds in govt introduced stv for local elections its a slog to create change nigel but worth it ,joswinson

2017-07-01 13:16:43+00:00,but shouldnt be forced into another divisive indyref either ,joswinson

2017-06-30 20:20:36+00:00,its a good idea at the moment not enough hours in day but gradually getting that sorted by spending time getting my team in place,joswinson
2017-06-30 20:18:27+00:00,maybe this is heresy but i also think its bigger than brexit distress i felt on was re what kind of country we are as well as re eu,joswinson
2017-06-30 20:11:29+00:00, yet this misinterpreted by some as wanting soft brexit just shouting no brexit unlikely to work need to chg voters minds takes time ,joswinson
2017-06-30 20:08:44+00:00, into less damaging brexit while maintaining our opposition to it calling for voters to have final say on deal ,joswinson
2017-06-30 20:07:33+00:00,i have read it concerns me but also how to square the circle it would feel irresponsible to refuse to use our parly votes to push govt ,joswinson
2017-06-30 19:58:44+00:00,we literally are theres a cross party group being formed ,joswinson
2017-06-30 19:57:19+00:00,indeed and i still hope ,joswinson
2017-06-30 19:51:51+00:00,thank you hopeful that within a few weeks much will be on the way to being sorted ,joswinson
2017-06-30 19:50:27+00:00,and given the numbers chance to force govt in better direction i think we should while maintaining overall opposition to brexit ,joswinson
2017-06-30 19:49:31+00:00,we are united against brexit in daily hoc votes we also have chance to pressure govt on their choices on how they are negotiating brexit ,joswinson
2017-06-30 19:30:50+00:00,abstained on labour amendment basically praising their whole manifesto as agree with some of it but not all esp e g not being in sing mkt,joswinson

2017-06-30 16:20:35+00:00, which is frustrating as obv im nowhere near as effective now as i will be when that is all in place ,joswinson

2017-06-30 11:22:58+00:00,sorry youve left brexit is not ok there is no better deal than remaining in eu we still need to push scrutinise govt at every step ,joswinson
2017-06-30 11:17:47+00:00,thank you for joining im genuinely confused do you think in hoc we shouldnt scrutinise brexit negotiations push for better outcomes ,joswinson

2016-11-11 15:21:42+00:00,it doesnt seem so but maybe behind closed doors ,joswinson
2016-11-11 15:20:13+00:00,yup i dont think youll find me saying that doesnt matter is irrelevant doesnt need changing,joswinson
2016-11-11 12:22:39+00:00,if by piece of work you mean critic of for dismissing gender pay gap then yes this is no time for complacency,joswinson
2016-11-11 10:52:51+00:00,no but unlike i dont pretend its irrelevant fine to have so few women at the top i work to change it,joswinson
2016-11-11 10:46:30+00:00,its not a panel on equal pay specifically was talking about it but research dept is men,joswinson

2016-11-10 22:09:53+00:00,i scrolled through two pages of results with no apparent filter just to see research also looked on research page,joswinson
2016-11-10 22:09:04+00:00,i agree suggesting gender pay gap is all down to unequal pay is not helpful but the campaign doesnt do that,joswinson
2016-11-10 22:08:15+00:00, some of the pay gap is sexism but employers can still act on the other bits too should be encouraged to,joswinson
2016-11-10 21:20:13+00:00,searching iea website for gender pay gap just brings up blogs that hardly enlighten no robust research or solutions,joswinson
2016-11-10 21:00:11+00:00,for the record like i prefer median measure but mean is not inflating just a different piece of information also relevant,joswinson
2016-11-10 20:46:59+00:00,heres some specifics ,joswinson
2016-11-10 20:46:03+00:00,i am aware of the figures re full time younger women note not true inc part time and im saying it is still a bleak picture,joswinson

2016-11-10 19:06:44+00:00,choosing to quote different figures from the same report may lead to interesting debate but hardly more rigorous ,joswinson
2016-11-10 19:05:30+00:00,whats a good thing the gender pay gap snail like progress to close it an all male research dept ,joswinson
2016-11-10 19:03:18+00:00,hence having a campaign on which was dubbed outdated as if theres not a big problem there absolutely is ,joswinson
2016-11-10 19:02:13+00:00,not disputing some of these causes certainly power very important but we do need to campaign to change it not accept it ,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:57:49+00:00,just think interesting that org with such male dominated research dept dismisses gender pay gap obv correlation not nec causality,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:38:41+00:00,your argument in tweet was dont use the mean if use median is nov still a big problem ,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:30:35+00:00,no im just pointing out an interesting correlation,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:29:25+00:00,ah that well known fact source some ranty random website ill stick with the ,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:27:29+00:00,i was assuming they might be basing their views on research,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:26:52+00:00,ok so you dont like the mean  but the median is either full time or overall still a problem,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:24:38+00:00,which fact and thanks for the personal development advice ,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:23:51+00:00,im not criticising the individuals but a research department of men dismissing gender pay gap against facts is noteworthy,joswinson
2016-11-10 18:19:11+00:00,theyre saying the mean is misleading it doesnt stack up because using the median still shows a big problem,joswinson
2016-11-10 17:57:15+00:00,no their argument doesnt stack up thought an interesting coincidence all of their research dept are men ,joswinson
2016-11-10 17:48:35+00:00,because thats whats wrong with  isnt it women are just doing too well ,joswinson
2016-11-10 17:45:14+00:00,women are just doing too well in  says criticising outdated campaign heres the whole iea research dept ,joswinson
2016-11-10 17:35:14+00:00,even if you used median its still a huge gap date would just change by a couple of weeks,joswinson
2016-11-10 16:53:38+00:00,afraid was rather sleep deprived post election,joswinson
2016-11-10 13:54:14+00:00,i think saying any might be over optimistic,joswinson

2016-07-20 21:38:14+00:00,not suggesting it is or should be just questioning whether that holds true for your fellow members,joswinson
2016-07-20 21:23:54+00:00,angela is much more credible than her opponents but its not about one person its the trend thats worrying,joswinson
2016-07-20 21:01:29+00:00,the women have great ability granted that doesnt always winning but always coming last ,joswinson
2016-07-20 20:59:50+00:00,but im still genuinely sad to see the state of labour,joswinson

2016-07-20 20:54:58+00:00,you can disagree with but i dont think you can seriously call her feeble ,joswinson
2016-07-20 20:50:59+00:00,who do you think should have run or do you think the women aged generally less good than the men and that explains it ,joswinson
2016-07-20 20:48:50+00:00,i think youre right not for a second saying were ok just depressing to see that stat when labour have loads of great women mps,joswinson
2016-07-20 15:46:35+00:00,insightful if depressing piece on labour women including the devastating fact below ,joswinson
2016-07-20 11:17:23+00:00,sounds divine ,joswinson
2016-07-20 07:33:02+00:00,brilliant by on online abuse its about power ,joswinson
2016-07-20 07:19:41+00:00,beautiful picture to start the day ,joswinson
2016-07-19 23:07:06+00:00,maybe but initial findings were almost ready mar  so its not just that its taking a while been dropped,joswinson
2016-07-19 21:12:36+00:00,this expose shows why government review of employment status should have continued ,joswinson
2016-07-19 20:27:21+00:00,indeed for those spewing racist bile its no more about the film than football hooliganism is about the game,joswinson
2016-07-19 19:19:53+00:00, i do love twitter,joswinson
2016-07-19 19:18:35+00:00,analysis misses key point leslie jones abused for daring to play a ghostbuster as a black woman h t,joswinson

2016-07-18 13:00:40+00:00,harassment is already a crime thats not a new law,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:59:22+00:00,discussing how we can create a better debate online is exactly what were doing some of the platforms have good ideas,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:57:53+00:00,youre saying you posted those words and they were what deleted ,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:57:11+00:00,which law is proposed that you disagree with ,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:55:19+00:00,have you had an idea that was not allowed ,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:54:11+00:00,i think someone has misled you about what were trying to do,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:53:09+00:00,nope still here and still campaigning to despite your disapproval,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:52:13+00:00,range of ideas being discussed in the campaign feel free to contribute,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:50:51+00:00,which law ,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:45:15+00:00,so promoting respectful debate is tyranny but intimidation is free speech ,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:43:15+00:00,no i dont,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:42:36+00:00,changing online norms is certainly part of it people would feel ashamed to say to someones face what some say online,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:39:26+00:00,no i am not responsible for what newspaper editors choose as headlines,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:38:17+00:00,of course no one is suggesting otherwise,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:36:28+00:00,no im not and youre wasting my time,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:34:57+00:00,opinions do not abuse,joswinson
2016-07-18 12:34:05+00:00,hi i dont think weve met yes i am a liberal a liberal democrat in fact represented the party for a decade in parliament,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:38:51+00:00,thanks for telling me what i want oh omniscient one but youre wrong have a nice day ,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:35:50+00:00, absolutely though also smart enough to recognise there is a different between criticism and hate speech,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:33:44+00:00,there is no right not to be offended but harassment is different rightly a crime doesnt always incl physical harm,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:31:27+00:00,yet blocking is exactly what many opponents of have been proposing instead of the need for wider change,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:27:57+00:00,it belongs to everyone and yes we can,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:24:30+00:00,this isnt about banning speech i disagree with very happy to engage in debate with those i disagree with,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:22:04+00:00,i support reclaim the internet but im not in the labour party your concern about the fee unrelated to online abuse issue,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:14:46+00:00,online abuse against anyone is part of the problem not sure which colleagues youre referring to though ,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:13:12+00:00,there is a difference sometimes its very clear and less so at the margins of course,joswinson
2016-07-18 11:11:16+00:00,not my party mate and a totally different issue,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:45:36+00:00,im less defeatist than you on this but of course youre entitled to your view cheers for the chat,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:41:20+00:00,think a wider response is needed in addition to blocking hence movement to find solutions,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:36:42+00:00, from twitter on response to online threats and abuse internet companies havent always got this right ,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:34:49+00:00,it doesnt work entirely doesnt help us hear the voices of those who dont speak up because of it,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:32:54+00:00,abuse is wrong in whatever direction and patience if i dont look at my phone for mins it might not be all about you ,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:03:15+00:00,only after theyve said it once and then set up new accounts etc its a useful tool but not a solution,joswinson
2016-07-18 10:02:08+00:00,low midge count theres optimism for you ,joswinson
2016-07-18 09:59:01+00:00,thats like saying to someone having abuse yelled at them constantly in the street to wear headphones its all fine,joswinson
2016-07-18 09:56:18+00:00,im totally up for respectful disagreement but you dont need to look very hard to see vile misogyny homophobia and racism online,joswinson
2016-07-18 09:52:30+00:00,my point is that many people are less free to speak because of intimidation so that has curtailed their freedom of speech,joswinson
2016-07-18 09:23:26+00:00,that would do so but thats not what is happening this conference is about navigating nuanced response,joswinson
2016-07-18 09:20:49+00:00,so you think hed disagree with laws against harassment really what about violence arguably also part of human condition ,joswinson
2016-07-18 08:58:24+00:00,what would he disagree with and why ,joswinson
2016-07-18 08:54:00+00:00,homophobic misogynistic racist abuse intimidation online curtail freedom of speech so as a liberal i support ,joswinson
2016-07-18 08:11:15+00:00, political debate online is being poisoned and it has to stop ahead of today,joswinson
2016-07-17 21:46:47+00:00,yes i am consistent were better off with scotland in uk and uk in eu,joswinson
2016-07-17 19:18:38+00:00,looking forward to conference tomorrow details here if you are also interested in coming along ,joswinson
2016-07-17 16:36:09+00:00,interesting and thoughtful analysis from my former colleague here,joswinson
2016-07-17 16:32:15+00:00,during election period leaflets designed to influence election outcome must by law carry imprint,joswinson
2016-07-17 16:29:46+00:00,i dont think any single party has a monopoly on patriotism,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:31:06+00:00,sure pity it isnt unless you think cabinet ftse boards etc being men is because theyre just somehow better,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:29:02+00:00,i agree happened to me in  police involved but no one ever caught,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:25:12+00:00,which shows how women are often perceived as having more power representation than is actually the case,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:24:36+00:00,it is some welcome progress i agree though other countries manage  point is cartoon is both patronising inaccurate,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:22:12+00:00,reminiscent of the indyref horrible division and disagreement turning really nasty,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:10:59+00:00, there are actually more women in that cartoon than will actually be sitting at the cabinet table ,joswinson
2016-07-17 12:09:11+00:00,plus they ignore fact that two thirds of new cabinet are blokes,joswinson
2016-07-17 11:59:19+00:00, anonymous leaflets are cowardly and pathetic and of course during election times also illegal,joswinson
2016-07-17 11:55:47+00:00,true though i think a bigger picture response than competence is necessary to navigate major faultlines in society,joswinson
2016-07-17 10:49:37+00:00,indeed i had that experience around the holyrood election first a little like nostalgia then rapidly boring,joswinson
2016-07-17 10:43:20+00:00,fascinating analysis of fledgling mayism and whether it is politically deliverable h t ,joswinson

2016-07-13 17:35:25+00:00, oh for heavens sake i was similarly excited to see a woman as first minister but that doesnt make me snp ,joswinson
2016-07-13 17:34:11+00:00,politics individual policy decisions aside it is a totemic and historic achievement,joswinson

2016-06-26 10:52:56+00:00,well i do think spoiling a ballot is preferable to staying at home,joswinson
2016-06-26 10:27:21+00:00,i had one when i was first elected ,joswinson
2016-06-26 10:26:13+00:00,indeed and the more volunteering in politics the more people can be engaged with,joswinson
2016-06-26 10:25:05+00:00,very much will this experience be a wake up call ,joswinson
2016-06-26 10:24:29+00:00,quite so no reason for young people or anyone to not vote because they dont know enough,joswinson
2016-06-26 10:23:36+00:00,agree that is a problem,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:51:48+00:00,plenty of people vote for all sorts of reasons so id always encourage people to have their say,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:51:05+00:00,that wasnt quite my point just that many think their opinions are somehow not valid enough and thats sad,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:49:50+00:00,hope one silver lining cld be folk realising votes important rather than cynical doesnt make a difference shrug,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:47:49+00:00,i understand though if you dont vote you let others decide and they may know less than you ,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:46:14+00:00,working together definitely good but challenge and debate also important and wont always agree,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:43:19+00:00,we can still analyse and learn from it,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:41:41+00:00, char challenge better education more diversity more young voices though chicken egg clear choices listening,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:37:55+00:00,quite possibly though another difference is that they get the chance in future elections in this case thats it ,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:34:25+00:00,the generational division is worrying,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:33:40+00:00,having campaigned for happy is very far from describing how i feel but indy no panacea amp wld bring many new probs,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:28:19+00:00,i agree the intergenerational issues are significant and of course  yr olds denied choice,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:27:00+00:00,or not a blame game but underlines importance of voting,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:26:31+00:00,good point though i hope research able to distinguish that effect as qs will be asked whether young voted,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:21:44+00:00,its not about blame just about understanding the result and analysis interesting for that,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:17:43+00:00,generational divide not usually so stark in opinions plus voting system means usually more complex,joswinson
2016-06-26 09:15:45+00:00,the fuller research by will be fascinating this is their early assessment,joswinson
2016-06-26 08:53:51+00:00,im sure theres a ninja way to fit voting into your day ,joswinson
2016-06-26 08:53:17+00:00,genuine debate to be had re inter generational fairness but suggesting young people cant find mins to vote is ridiculous,joswinson
2016-06-26 08:29:19+00:00,interesting many boroughs had more people registered than ever before,joswinson

2016-04-05 12:44:40+00:00, sentence above graph clearly shows it is about spl though this is sub sample those who had new child recently,joswinson
2016-04-05 12:32:05+00:00, govt could commission research getting lge enough amp reprstive sample of new parents is challenge but not impossible,joswinson
