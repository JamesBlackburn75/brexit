2019-10-22 20:57:46+00:00,johnson is the author of his own misfortune he only tried to bounce his deal through parliament because he knows it will not withstand scrutiny a brexit deal driven by the ideology of deregulation must be stopped ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-22 20:05:11+00:00,really significant votes tonight parliament defeated johnson s attempt to rush through his deeply flawed deal i spoke with many colleagues who agonised over these votes whether you agree or disagree they should be respected ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-21 20:20:21+00:00,ministers are trying to bounce mps into signing off a bill that could cause huge damage to our country boris johnson knows that the more time people have to read the small print of his deal the more it will be exposed for the risks it represents to our economy and communities ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-21 20:20:20+00:00,this is a bill to implement boris johnson s deeply flawed plan for brexit it is outrageous to deny parliament the chance to scrutinise this incredibly important legislation properly ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-20 09:48:19+00:00,the fight against boris johnson s brexit is a fight for the future of our country ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-19 20:50:06+00:00,thank you that means a lot ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-19 16:12:18+00:00,if anyone is wondering why labour and the trade union movement could not support boris johnson s brexit watch this video ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-19 12:57:53+00:00,boris johnson s brexit stands against everything the labour and trade union movement stands for ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-19 09:10:09+00:00,five reasons to rules out a customs union rejects a close single market relationship risks a no deal crash out at the end of does not address concerns about security and cooperation you can t trust boris johnson,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-18 20:52:12+00:00,tomorrow is not just about whether a johnson deal gets over the line it s about the political future of our nation we have to defeat him so that our values of internationalism peace human rights can win ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-18 18:56:02+00:00,you only have to look at how boris johnson has treated the dup to tell he cannot be trusted he will turn his back on anyone to suit his own personal ambition that is why labour and the trade union movement can t support his deal tomorrow ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-18 11:05:40+00:00,if anyone has any doubts about where boris johnson s proposals take us this lays bare that the end destination is a damaging right wing project which will rip apart our relationship with the eu and replace it with a us style economy ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:38+00:00,labour cannot support this deal if boris johnson has confidence in his deal he should put it back to the people in a public vote against remain and that is an argument we will be making on saturday ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:38+00:00,labour will not support a flawed brexit deal that harms jobs rights and living standards this deal will unquestionably do that ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:38+00:00,instead the level playing field provisions only last until the end of transition with a warning shot from the eu about the impact this will have on reduced access to eu markets ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:37+00:00,the level playing field commitments are significantly weaker no longer building on the measures in the old withdrawal agreement which provided for dynamic alignment in certain areas ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:37+00:00,on services the pd offers nothing beyond the weak provisions in the theresa may deal nor has there been any progress on the question of agencies and our future security relationship ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:37+00:00,this inevitably means there will be new trade barriers with the eu and additional checks at borders the pd is explicit about this and the johnson deal makes it easier for a tory government to cut rights and standards ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:36+00:00,rather than strengthening the political declaration pd along the lines labour argued the political direction of travel under johnson is to a distant economic relationship with the eu it rules out a new customs union and a close future relationship with the single market ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:36+00:00,having reviewed what has been agreed it is clear that the johnson deal is a far worse deal than theresa may s deal it paves the way for a decade of deregulation it gives johnson licence to slash workers rights environmental standards and consumer protections ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:35+00:00,labour s concerns with theresa may s deal were not principally about the backstop they were about the political declaration and our future relationship with the eu after brexit ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-17 14:27:35+00:00,excuse the long thread but i have looked carefully at the negotiated by boris johnson here is my analysis ,Keir_Starmer

2019-10-10 21:25:54+00:00,great to be with you tonight supporting a great candidate in a seat we need to win ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-09 20:21:23+00:00,andrea leadsom s comments are neither the spirit nor the letter of the law if there is no deal by the end of next week the prime minister must ask for and accept an extension one letter no equivocation ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-08 22:29:01+00:00,desperate ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-08 21:20:19+00:00,dangerous but deliberate we have a reckless prime minister who never takes responsibility for his actions ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-08 15:29:28+00:00,the governments brexit proposals were designed to fail boris johnson is playing fast and loose with the countrys future ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-08 09:42:59+00:00,it is now more important than ever that parliament unites to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the eu at the end of the month ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-08 09:41:51+00:00,this is yet another cynical attempt by number to sabotage the negotiations boris johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal his strategy from day one has been for a no deal brexit ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-04 21:14:51+00:00,this requires answers ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-04 20:27:54+00:00,my take pm will try to close down negotiations this weekend because he knows his proposals are well wide of the mark then he will refuse to go to eu summit all part of the blame game choreography ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-04 19:47:31+00:00,because he has a problem with the truth ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-04 15:06:51+00:00,the benn act is very clear if johnson can t get a deal through or agreement to no deal by oct he must seek accept an extension anything else is unlawful ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-04 08:52:38+00:00,it s friday so it s constituency advice surgery day long queue already but strong coffee and my great casework team on hand ,Keir_Starmer

2019-10-02 21:11:40+00:00,classic hard brexit nonsense ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-02 20:56:04+00:00,johnson s brexit plan is going nowhere did he seriously think otherwise more likely a cynical move not really intended to succeed ,Keir_Starmer
2019-10-01 11:21:32+00:00,congratulations now we need to get you selected as the candidate full support ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-30 21:08:23+00:00,if accurate these proposals represent yet another failure of the government s negotiating strategy the prime minister should admit he has no credible plan for brexit and that the only way to resolve this issue is to go back to the people with a public vote ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-30 21:08:23+00:00,crucially if true they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of northern ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-30 21:08:23+00:00,they would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-30 21:08:22+00:00,if boris johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in northern ireland he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-30 18:45:40+00:00,right decision should never have gone down this road ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-30 08:46:40+00:00,great to campaign with you ,Keir_Starmer

2019-09-29 14:51:17+00:00,thank you ann clwyd for all your incredible service to amp the wider labour movement ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-28 20:43:35+00:00,whipping up the idea of riots or even deaths is the height of irresponsibility but it is also pretty obviously being orchestrated if this is part of johnson s plan to misuse powers under emergency legislation we will defeat him in court and in parliament ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-28 17:10:19+00:00,really great team out in putney today thanks for inviting me to join you ,Keir_Starmer

2019-09-27 08:43:50+00:00,after a week starting with party conference in brighton then supreme court decision ruling against pm his appalling behaviour since it s a relief to be starting a busy constituency advice surgery today with my brilliant casework team ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-26 21:50:55+00:00,it s a deliberate strategy but truth is only a weak prime minister sets out to divide we will not fall for this a strong leader unifies he knows he is not a strong leader ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-26 08:32:45+00:00,this morning i have written to michael gove demanding answers about operation yellowhammer a no deal brexit is not a game yesterday the public were subjected to the spectacle of a government minister playing politics with the future of our country ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-25 20:50:36+00:00,the pm has no human decency no sense of public duty only a profound belief in his own entitlement ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-25 16:49:50+00:00,this is not a game for the government to be five weeks away from a no deal brexit without a plan is unforgivable ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-24 21:56:39+00:00,if you have no moral compass no principles and no regard for the truth of course you think johnson s doing a fantastic job ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-24 21:30:02+00:00,whether johnson agrees with the court or not is irrelevant he acted unlawfully he needs to explain himself in parliament tomorrow ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-24 14:11:00+00:00,the attorney general should publish the legal advice he gave the prime minister on prorogation if he fails to do so parliament should force its release ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-24 09:50:42+00:00,strong judgement from the court proves boris johnson has no regard for the law yet again he has been found out the sooner we resume our work challenging and defeating him the better ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-21 20:13:11+00:00,fantastic to speak at s reception london needs a labour governnent a labour mayor and more labour councils ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-21 16:20:51+00:00,great to join this afternoon s rally at we can t trust boris johnson with the future of our country only a labour can deliver the referendum we need to break the brexit deadlock ,Keir_Starmer

2019-09-17 21:50:48+00:00,this is clear evidence that any suggestion that shutting down parliament was to prepare for a queen s speech is bogus ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-14 22:26:56+00:00,you don t say ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-14 22:20:44+00:00,johnson cummings are destroying the conservative party ,Keir_Starmer

2019-09-11 19:42:47+00:00, it is also now more important than ever that parliament is recalled and has the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-11 19:42:35+00:00, boris johnson must now admit that he has been dishonest with the british people about the consequence of a no deal brexit ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-11 19:41:58+00:00, these documents confirm the severe risks of a no deal brexit which labour has worked so hard to block it is completely irresponsible for the government to have tried to ignore these stark warnings and prevent the public from seeing the evidence ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-11 19:35:27+00:00,this is as dangerous as it is pathetic some of us have worked in countries where impartiality of the judges is not guaranteed ministers spouting this disgraceful nonsense should spend time there before offering these views ,Keir_Starmer
2019-09-11 11:23:26+00:00,boris johnson has been found out parliament must be recalled immediately ,Keir_Starmer

2019-03-28 17:29:50+00:00,fourth following the pm s commitment yesterday to resign before the next phase of negotiations begin if the withdrawal agreement passes without a credible plan for what happens next then brexit is going to be determined by the outcome of the next tory leadership contest ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-28 17:29:31+00:00,third the pm has said the two documents should be treated as one on january she said the link between the two documents means that the commitments of one cannot be banked without the commitments of the other the eu has been clear that they come as a package ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-28 17:29:05+00:00,second in their letter of january presidents tusk and juncker said as for the link between the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration it can be made clear that these two documents while being of a different nature are part of the same negotiated package ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-28 17:28:42+00:00,first the article process explicitly states that the eu and member state must negotiate an agreement setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union ,Keir_Starmer

2019-03-25 22:27:34+00:00,another humiliating defeat for a prime minister who has lost complete control of her party her cabinet and of the brexit process parliament has fought back and now has the chance to decide what happens next ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-24 11:56:21+00:00,the prime minister has lost control of brexit and thrown our country into crisis this week parliament must be given the chance to take control ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-24 11:29:11+00:00,this is a classic response from the government having lost control of events the brexit secretary indicates the government would frustrate any attempt by parliament to break the deadlock we are only in this crisis because ministers have pushed parliament away at every turn ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-21 20:09:43+00:00,whatever happens in the coming days one thing is clear the prime minister has no mandate and no right to threaten our country with a no deal brexit if she is unwilling to show leadership at a time of national crisis then parliament must be given the chance to do so ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-21 20:09:20+00:00,the divisive rhetoric she used last night was simply wrong whipping up populism is not the solution and can never be allowed to succeed in our country we must do all we can to protect the values of our democracy ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-21 20:08:46+00:00,i ve been reflecting on what theresa may said last night the reality is that we are in this crisis because of her the prime minister is simply incapable of reflecting on her own failed strategy and the reckless red lines she put down at the beginning of the negotiations ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-20 09:15:03+00:00,what the government should be doing is showing real leadership making good on their commitment to break the deadlock and secure an extension with a genuine purpose ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-20 09:14:37+00:00,the prime minister appears to be pursuing a course of action that her own deputy last week described as reckless theresa may is desperate once again to impose a binary choice between her deal and no deal despite parliament clearly ruling out both of those options last week ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-18 10:07:04+00:00,another powerful international law voice relying on article vienna convention to get the pm s brexit deal through would be an obvious exam failing non starter ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-18 09:57:39+00:00,powerful analysis from leading international lawyer any attempt by govt to rely on article vienna convention to break brexit deadlock would be entirely without merit ,Keir_Starmer

2019-03-17 11:46:41+00:00, right to be supportive of the and proposal as i said in parliament last week we must support the lock of a public vote to prevent a damaging tory brexit or no deal being imposed on our country ,Keir_Starmer

2019-03-14 19:47:39+00:00,this evening the brexit secretary voted against his government s own motion on brexit which earlier in the day he had defended in the house of commons that s the equivalent of the chancellor voting against his own budget this is a government that has lost complete control ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-13 21:17:10+00:00,the implication in the prime minister s motion for tomorrow that she intends to put her twice failed deal to a third vote in the next two weeks exposes the reason she keeps losing blinkered intransigence ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-13 20:09:29+00:00,labour said for two years that no deal should never be an option extraordinary that the government voted to keep it alive parliament knew better and has overruled the prime minister she must accept that result and let mps decide what happens next ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 23:05:39+00:00,tomorrow s task is to take no deal off the table ,Keir_Starmer

2019-03-12 11:10:59+00:00,attorney general confirms that there have been no significant changes to the withdrawal agreement despite the legal documents that were agreed last night the government s strategy is now in tatters ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:50:51+00:00,my statement in full ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:50:14+00:00,turning the content of the january letter from donald tusk and jean claude juncker into a joint interpretative declaration does not change that nor in my view does anything else agreed last night ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:49:51+00:00,however the withdrawal agreement does not include a mechanism for unilateral exit from or termination of the backstop or any other part of the agreement even where bad faith is made out ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:49:26+00:00,under article of the withdrawal agreement if either side is found to have acted in breach of the good faith best endeavours obligation the strongest remedy is temporary suspension of parts of the agreement to force the other side back to the negotiating table ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:49:01+00:00,in that advice the attorney general said that under international law the backstop would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement takes its place in whole or in part ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:48:40+00:00,having studied the documents i would be surprised if they are sufficient to enable the attorney general to change the central plank of his december legal advice ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-12 07:47:51+00:00,overnight i have looked carefully at what has been agreed by the prime minister with the european union in relation to the backstop ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-11 12:36:26+00:00,it s imperative that the prime minister answers in the commons today accountability for the complete mess we are in lies with her ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-10 21:42:58+00:00,just the right tone from my clp antisemitism has no place in our movement we fight for our party a party of tolerance inclusivity equality ,Keir_Starmer
2019-03-10 12:30:42+00:00,the prime minister is preparing to bring back the exact same deal parliament rejected in january that s not progress that s eight weeks of failure ,Keir_Starmer

2019-03-06 12:02:05+00:00,excellent article from the tories have no interest in protecting workers rights the prime minister s words are hollow and meaningless ,Keir_Starmer

2019-01-09 14:31:25+00:00,the government s decision to delay the meaningful vote has run down the clock and increased the risk of a no deal brexit if the prime minister s brexit deal is defeated next week she must return to parliament as soon as possible and give mps a real say on what happens next ,Keir_Starmer
2019-01-09 12:44:17+00:00,the prime minister s reassurances on her brexit deal amount to nothing the government could never have frozen parliament out of the choice of extending transition or entering the backstop pm has not delivered the significant changes that she promised ,Keir_Starmer

2018-12-19 11:26:21+00:00,a no deal brexit would be catastrophic no government has the right to plunge the country into chaos because of its own failure the majority in parliament must have its voice heard that s why i will be applying for this emergency debate today ,Keir_Starmer

2018-12-14 06:41:20+00:00,it seems that the prime minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her brexit deal we cannot go on like this the prime minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let parliament take back control ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-13 20:52:43+00:00,too right one year on we see how important this is ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-12 22:12:23+00:00,result also shows how badly the pm would have lost the vote last night on her brexit deal had she not cancelled it again more trouble ahead ,Keir_Starmer

2018-12-05 11:33:31+00:00,it is unthinkable that the government tried to keep this information from parliament and indeed the public before next week s vote ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-05 11:33:07+00:00,all week we have heard from government ministers that releasing this information could harm the national interest nothing of the sort all this advice reveals is the central weaknesses in the government s deal ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-05 11:32:44+00:00,having reviewed the attorney general s legal advice it s obvious why this needed to be placed in the public domain ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-04 17:15:01+00:00,today s finding of contempt is a real low point for this government by treating parliament with contempt the government has lost the respect of the house ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-03 23:00:11+00:00,ministers have repeatedly refused to release the attorney general s full and final legal advice on their brexit deal as ordered by parliament we have been left with no option but to press ahead with contempt this is our cross party motion that will be debated tomorrow ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-03 18:00:04+00:00,the government has failed to publish the attorney generals full and final legal advice on the brexit deal as was ordered by parliament we have been left with no option but to write to the speaker of the house of commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-02 10:30:19+00:00,on i warned the government that it is heading for deep water if it doesn t publish the full legal advice on the prime minister s deal as ordered by parliament ,Keir_Starmer
2018-12-01 23:04:54+00:00,so the pm insists that mps cannot see the ag s legal advice on brexit while members of the cabinet feel free to leak it completely unacceptable ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-30 22:23:22+00:00,good as i have said repeatedly parliament is not going to fall for pm s my deal or no deal bluff that s no way to decide such an important issue as our future relationship with the eu ,Keir_Starmer

2018-11-25 12:03:55+00:00,this is a bad deal for our country it s a failure of negotiation by a prime minister who has spent more time arguing with her party than working in the national interest the result is a deal that no one supports labour will vote against it ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-24 23:54:03+00:00,yes i will thanks for all you are doing ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-22 15:15:29+00:00,this is a further failure of negotiation promises have been broken and serious questions about our future with the eu remain unanswered this is not a deal labour can support we will vote against ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-21 09:08:29+00:00,amber rudd is right parliament will stop no deal i hope the rest of the cabinet was listening and will finally drop the reckless no deal rhetoric ,Keir_Starmer

2018-11-15 09:29:58+00:00,this is now an incredibly serious situation the prime minister s brexit deal has fallen at the first hurdle when theresa may makes her statement to parliament this morning she can t stand up and say nothing has changed she needs to urgently to rethink her approach ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-15 07:04:39+00:00,the opposite of what has been promised for two years ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-15 07:04:18+00:00,vague in the extreme on the future relationship which is meant to be the government s preferred option not good enough for manufacturing not good enough for services and lacking any robust safeguards for our vital rights and protections ,Keir_Starmer

2018-11-13 22:25:17+00:00,important victory today govt needs to be clear and accountable about the legal implications of any brexit deal it seeks to push through parliament ,Keir_Starmer
2018-11-13 18:43:29+00:00,given the shambolic handling of these negotiations this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to protect jobs and the economy it s not in the national interest to vote for a bad deal ,Keir_Starmer
